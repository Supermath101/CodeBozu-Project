The US rejoined it under Joe Biden.//What does Trump actually believe on climate change? //Mr Obama reserved some of his strongest criticism for the Republican Party. He accused its members of stalling progress by "sitting on the sidelines" and making climate change a partisan issue with "four years of active hostility toward climate science".//He said Republicans who take climate change seriously are "a rare breed right now."

He even acknowledged that he doesn't have all the answers and at times gets discouraged, but he said the energy and efforts of young people give him faith in the future.//It was a delicate balance for a former president who made "hope and change" his trademark line. //But the rhetoric was reflective of the tenuous nature of current US climate polices, which are dependent on Democratic majorities that could vanish in coming elections even though, Mr Obama said, there is still much work left to do.

Former President Barack Obama has scaled back his birthday bash - leaving a few hundred rich and famous at home like the rest of us. //The last-minute change of course comes as Covid-19 cases, deaths and hospital admissions rise around the globe - driven by the highly contagious Delta variant.//Delta has dimmed dreams of a two-shot summer full of mask-free and un-distanced social gatherings - and not just for Mr Obama. //"The rules of the game with Delta have changed a little bit," says Dr Abraar Karan, an infectious disease expert at Stanford University. "This is a reminder to people that the virus never really left, and it's back in a meaningful way now." //So what does that mean for your summer plans? The BBC asked health experts and a Covid-conscious event planner how you should approach get-togethers during this so-called summer of freedom.//To commemorate the big 6-0, former President Obama had reportedly invited around 500 of his closest friends - plus 200 staff - to join him this weekend at his Martha's Vineyard vacation home. //Some guests had already arrived when Mr Obama announced the change in plans on Wednesday. His party will be "significantly scaled back" due to the Delta variant, a spokeswoman said, to host only family and close friends. //But if you've still got an invite to a similarly swanky - and sizeable - celebration, should you go? //Dr Amesh Adalja, a senior researcher in infectious disease and pandemic preparedness at Johns Hopkins University, says the key is vaccination status.//"The vaccines are working perfectly to prevent serious disease," Dr Adalja told the BBC in an email, adding that any breakthrough infection for the vaccinated would be "like a common cold or even less". //"I would have no problems attending any of these events as a fully vaccinated individual."//But Stanford's Dr Karan advocates for more caution, and would opt out of a celebration of this size. His main concern would be the travel before and after possibly spreading infections as guests come and go.//So if you have your own large gathering coming up, ensuring attendees are fully vaccinated is an importantÂ first step. Even better - move the party outside and reacquaint yourself with socially distanced socialising.Â //The good news is that compliance for private parties is likely to be high, says Lauren Schaefer, whose events company The Get Together offers a Covid-coordinating service to clients.//"Guests are willing to do whatever they have to do to celebrate with their loved ones," she says. And if some guests are either Covid-wary or restriction-averse -"they're allowed not to come". //This past weekend, Chicago's Lollapalooza drew an estimated 100,000 people for every day of the four-day music festival, held in the city's Grant Park.//To attend, people had to provide proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test. Masks were required in indoor spaces.//Lollapalooza's organiser said last week that 90% of attendees showed proof of vaccination. Some 600 people were turned away for not having the correct paperwork. //But photos and videos of the event showing a sea of unmasked revellers have raised concerns of a bump in Covid-19 cases.//Dr Karan has decided to skip music festivals entirely this summer. And given the current caseload in the US, he does not think a gathering this large should have been held at all. //With hundreds of thousands of people involved, you can't reliably verify that everyone is vaccinated or properly tested, he says. "You're going to have spread - that's inevitable." //And while many of those crowded together in downtown Chicago might have been vaccinated young people - not particularly at risk of serious illness - there's no way of knowing the risk they pose to others.//"A lot of these people in their late teens and twenties are going to go home to parents," Dr Karan says.  //If you're still eyeing some festival fun this summer, Dr Karan recommends a return to the coronavirus basics: wear a mask, stay outdoors, and keep as much distance from others as possible. //For those opting out of large-scale festivals and parties this summer, a backyard neighbourhood gathering might still be on the agenda.//Dr Karan and Dr Adalja are in agreement on this one: you can RSVP "yes" to a small, outdoor gathering of this kind.//Neighbourhood barbecues boast a particular benefit, Dr Karan says, as you are staying close to home and avoiding infection on the plane or train journey there. //But which neighbourhood you find yourself in matters too. //Cities in the US range widely in terms of vaccination rates and caseloads. At a party in Santa Cruz County, Arizona, for example, where 78% of residents are vaccinated, you may be more at ease than in Miami, Florida.//That doesn't mean you should be handshaking and hugging your way through the night, Dr Karan notes. Risk should still be minimised whenever possible.//Delta has not yet driven us back to square one - but ditching Covid-19 precautions right now would be premature, according to Dr Karan, and adapting to the latest data will be critical. //"There are going to be some people who say: 'you promised us we'd never have to wear masks again,'" he says. "But there's no such thing as never in a pandemic. //"We can't predict the future, we can only do our best to keep people safe." ", 12.8%

Notably the programmes they do pick are often pretty safe, critically acclaimed and/or middle of the road."//Webber adds that Mr Sunak, who she says is known for his slick image, "may have actually given himself an edge by leaning into his trashy tastes and going for Emily in Paris - just as he did last year when he named songs by Michael Buble and Mariah Carey as his favourite Christmas tunes." //In light of his admission, we've rounded up the TV shows enjoyed by high-profile politicians from across the political spectrum on both sides of the pond...//Like Mr Sunak, Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary, herself a former presidential candidate, found themselves gripped by Bridgerton. //In an interview with the show's executive producer, Shonda Rhimes, for his Why Am I Telling You This? podcast, Mr Clinton said he and Hillary had binged on the period drama so intensely that "the sun was coming up Sunday morning when we finished it".//He also discussed his wife's reaction to British-Zimbabwean actor RegÃ©-Jean Page, an instant heartthrob in his leading role as Simon, the Duke of Hastings - an eligible but rebellious young bachelor in the show's alternative telling of Regency era London's debutante balls.//"Hillary just kept saying over and over again all night long, 'That's the most beautiful man I ever saw on television', said Mr Clinton. "I kept wanting him to get bumped off after a while."//Speaking to BBC Arts correspondent Rebecca Jones about the actor's departure, Mr Clinton added: "I thought he was great. I thought it was a masterpiece but things change, lives change, people can't do it any more. All kinds of things happen."//Beyond Bridgerton, one Rhimes-produced show Mr Clinton will have perhaps watched alone is political drama Scandal. //Back in 2013, its star Kerry Washington told Entertainment Weekly the former president had outed himself as a fan - much to her surprise.//The role saw her play White House aide turned crisis consultant Olivia Pope who has an affair with the president. //Her character is based on Judy Smith, a DC crisis manager and former deputy press secretary to President George HW Bush, whose high-profile client list included Monica Lewinsky - the White House intern Mr Clinton admitted to having an extra-marital affair with while in office.//The ardent Brexiteer said he was too busy to watch TV when asked about his viewing habits in the run up to the 2015 UK general election.//However, Mr Farage's wife Kirsten told The Telegraph in 2014: "We honestly don't watch a lot of telly but he loves Dad's Army, he loves all the 70s stuff that they still repeat."//Broadchurch and Homeland were Mr Miliband's favourite TV programmes ahead of the 2015 general election. However, he admitted that if his kids were awake, the whole family would often find themselves watching The Octonauts on CBeebies.//Settle down to watch TV with the Cameron household after dinner and it seems you may well end up hiding behind the sofa. //Mr Cameron has previously said he enjoys gritty dramas and murder mysteries such as The Killing, Case Histories, Midsomer Murders and Silent Witness, while also being partial to an episode of Shameless and Breaking Bad.//But sometimes, likely when in need of light relief, Mr Cameron said he enjoyed turning to BBC sitcom Gavin and Stacey (despite listing the 1970s classic Porridge as his all-time favourite).//"There's no doubt in my mind that Wales has produced the finest sitcom to come out in the last five years: of course, Gavin & Stacey," he said in 2012, after meeting one of the show's Welsh stars, Stacey actress Joanna Page, at Downing Street.//"I think we have some of the cast here tonight, have we? Very good. Well, it's tidy to have you here," he later joked.//As prime minister Mr Cameron took a keen interest in UK TV - personally lobbying for lengthier series of hit shows.//Scotland's first minister is a long-standing fan of Danish political drama, Borgen.//The show, which drew huge audiences to BBC Four before ending after three seasons in 2013, followed fictional prime minister Birgitte Nyborg, played by Sidse Babett Knudsen, as she lead a coalition government. //While her career finds success, her marriage fails and her relationship with her children is tested.//Speaking to The Herald ahead of the final series, Ms Sturgeon said it was "without doubt" the "most authentic" political drama she's ever watched, particularly as a high-profile female politician herself.//The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter//"What is nice about Borgen is it portrays this obviously strong, confident, clever and articulate woman, but you also see her human side and the fact that she occasionally has self-doubt, which everyone does.//"It shows politicians in a good light, not as perfect or flawless, [Nyborg] is perfectly capable of deploying the dark arts, but comes across as a decent human being."//She added: "You see her vulnerability, the traumas she goes through in her family life and kicking off her high heels at the end of a busy day. All of that, for women in politics, is something you can kind of relate to."//The pair eventually crossed paths in real life, with Ms Sturgeon, then deputy leader, introducing a special screening of the show at Edinburgh's Filmhouse, where Knudsen was hosting a series of Q&A sessions with loyal Borgen fans.//In true political style, the duo used the opportunity to pose for photos, with the actress gifting Ms Sturgeon a box set of the show.//Life in the Oval Office hot seat likely leaves little time for relaxation, especially during a global pandemic. //But back when serving as vice president to Barack Obama in 2012, Mr Biden admitted he'd caught clips of TLC's Here Comes Honey Boo Boo while flying on Air Force Two.//The show, starring the then seven-year-old beauty queen formally known as Alana Thompson, whose sass on Toddlers and Tiaras made her a household name, had quickly become a reality TV smash.//In an interview on Miami's WMIA radio station, Mr Biden said that while he counted US comedies Modern Family and Parks and Recreation as his favourite shows, his granddaughter told him to keep an eye out for Honey Boo Boo.//"Honey Boo Boo is not top on my list, but I am aware just you know by catching snippets on Air Force Two, [she's] quite a phenomenon," he said.//Given how Mrs May's penchant for dancing regularly shone through during her premiership - including at the Conservative Party Conference - perhaps it is unsurprising that she came out as a vocal fan of BBC talent show Strictly Come Dancing.//After her 'Maybot' move became a viral sensation when she debuted it to a group of scouts during a trip to Kenya, the former home secretary offered to give dance "tips" to the latest batch of Strictly constants in 2018.//The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter//Her love for the show even seeped into wrangling over plans for a televised debate over Brexit negotiations. When then Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn rejected BBC proposals, cheekily suggesting on This Morning that he would prefer it to run on ITV so he could watch I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! straight afterwards, Mrs May said she would not appear on ITV for the debate because she, in turn, would miss Strictly.//"I'm keen to have a head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn," Mrs May told This Morning. "I hope this goes throughâ¦ he said he wanted to be on ITV so he could watch the final of I'm a Celebrity.//"I think his proposal meant that I would miss Strictly. I hate to say this on ITV but I'm a bit of a Strictly fan."//In reality, there were also disagreements over the format of the debate and what other parties would take part. //The head-to-head debate was eventually called off as a result of the stalemate.//Mr Trump's avid consumption and often lacerating criticism of TV news became a hallmark of his infamous Twitter feed.//But as much a television personality as a politician, Mr Trump had made a string of TV appearances - most notably as the host of The Apprentice in the US - before his successful White House bid in 2016.//Always full of brash confidence, he told People magazine in 2015 that his "guilty pleasure" TV was literally watching himself during an appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).//"[It] got great ratings. The best ratings in years. It was a terrific success. I enjoyed doing it," he said, before claiming it got substantially more viewers than Mrs Clinton's episode.//However, his love for SNL did not last long as president, following a series of sketches parodying his administration.//As a challenger for the Republican presidential ticket ahead of the 2016 election, Mr Cruz initially denounced Trump before throwing his support behind him, even over his baseless claims of fraud after the 2020 election.//Mr Cruz's TV choices could be said to reflect the cut and thrust of politics - speaking to People magazine for the same article as Trump in 2015, he named Game of Thrones and US political satire Veep as two of his favourite shows. //Beyond escaping into fantasy and comedy, as a Harvard Law School graduate he also revealed he enjoyed Criminal Minds, and, like Mr Cameron, Breaking Bad. //Since leaving office in 2017, Mr Obama has published an annual culture list - including his standouts across TV, film, music and literature. Together with wife Michelle, he has even launched a TV production company, Higher Ground productions, that helped support Oscar-nominated documentary Crip Camp. //The list for 2020 included Netflix's chess drama The Queen's Gambit, starring Anya Taylor-Joy, as well as British actor, writer and comedian Michaela Coel's critically acclaimed BBC series I May Destroy You. //Bafta Awards honour multi-talented Michaela Coel//Mr Obama had also previously commended BBC comedy Fleabag - sparking much amusement given that its star and creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge is caught finding her own pleasure in the former president's speech-making abilities during one episode.//Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
