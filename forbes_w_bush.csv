"Report: Bill Clinton And Ghislaine Maxwell Had A ‘Secret Dinner’ In 2014", "Former President Bill Clinton had a hush-hush dinner at a Los Angeles restaurant in 2014 at which one of his guests was Ghislaine Maxwell, who allegedly recruited underage girls for Jeffrey Epstein, according to a report from The Daily Beast, which raises more questions about Clinton’s connections with Epstein following the publication last month of pictures showing the president receiving a massage from an alleged Epstein victim.//Former President Bill Clinton had a hush-hush dinner at a Los Angeles restaurant in 2014 at which one of his guests was Ghislaine Maxwell, who allegedly recruited underage girls for Jeffrey Epstein, according to a report from The Daily Beast, which raises more questions about Clinton’s connections with Epstein following the publication last month of pictures showing the president receiving a massage from an alleged Epstein victim.//Former President Bill Clinton, left, and Ghislaine Maxwell. //Maxwell was on the guest list for a dinner at vegan hotspot Crossroads Kitchen on February 27, 2014, according to the Beast, along with tech CEO Scott Borgerson, Maxwell’s reported boyfriend at the time.//Democratic donor and Clinton friend Steve Bing—who died by suicide earlier in 2020—was also in attendance, according to the Beast, along with former Clinton staffers who reportedly said they hadn’t met Maxwell or had no recollection of her at the dinner.//Clinton’s team argued over whether to extend an invitation to Maxwell, the Beast reported, citing unnamed sources, because at the time, at least one alleged victim had accused Maxwell of recruiting underage girls for Epstein’s sex ring.//Maxwell had reportedly been cut out of Clinton’s social circle in 2011, according to the report, but was somehow reinstated by 2014, when deputy chief of staff Jon Davidson supposedly organized the dinner. //The Beast said Clinton had six or seven guests at the dinner and described it as intimate; a Clinton spokesperson said there were 20 guests.//Representatives for Maxwell did not respond to requests for comment by Forbes; Clinton spokesman Angel Urena told Forbes that the former president has not been accused of any wrongdoing.//“Think of all the people [Clinton] knows in L.A., and Ghislaine gets to attend,” an anonymous source told the Beast about the dinner//Questions have swirled around Clinton’s connection to Epstein since the disgraced financier was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019. Those questions intensified after Epstein died of suicide in a Manhattan lockup one month later. In a 2019 statement, Clinton told Forbes he “knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago,” in reference to Epstein’s much-maligned 2008 plea deal brokered by former Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta, who was a U.S. attorney at the time. Clinton also said in his statement he was never at Epstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, although court records released July 31 from a settled defamation lawsuit between Maxwell and alleged victim Virginia Giuffre say Maxwell flew on a helicopter with Clinton to the island. And, on August 18, British tabloid The Daily Mail published photos of Clinton appearing to receive a neck massage from alleged Epstein victim Chauntae Davies in 2002, who was 22 at the time. The photos appeared just hours before Clinton’s speech at the Democratic National Convention, raising eyebrows as to the timing of their release. Maxwell has been held in a Brooklyn federal prison since her July arrest on charges of enticing and transporting minors as part of Epstein’s alleged sex ring and committing perjury during her 2016 depositions that are part of the Giuffre defamation case. Maxwell entered a not guilty plea, and her trial is slated to begin in July 2021.//President Trump socialized with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s, although he quickly distanced himself following Epstein’s 2019 arrest. Trump had kinder words for Maxwell after she was arrested and charged this year, saying “I wish her well” during a July 22 White House press conference. //Revealed: Bill Clinton’s Intimate Secret Dinner With Ghislaine Maxwell (The Daily Beast)//Photos Allegedly Show Bill Clinton Receiving Massage From Jeffrey Epstein Accuser (Forbes)//Here’s Every Time Donald Trump And Ghislaine Maxwell Have Been Photographed Together (Forbes)//Ghislaine Maxwell Records Trove Names Jeffrey Epstein, Alan Dershowitz—And More Documents Could Be Released (Forbes)//", 2.8%

However, Davies told the Mail there was “no foul play,” and that Clinton was a “perfect gentleman.”//Though Donald Trump Jr. and other Republicans were quick to seize on the photos before the speech, President Trump took aim at Clinton after the speech for citing the high number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. “Tell the Dems that we have more Cases because we do FAR more Testing than any other Country,” Trump tweeted, repeating an argument repeatedly debunked by experts.//44%.

"The Lessons From Bill Clinton’s Impeachment: Markets Are Better Learners Than Politicians", "In an essay entitled “Passions, Politics and the Removal of a President: Lessons Learned from the Impeachment of President Clinton,” which appeared in Grove City College’s Journal of Law & Public Policy, former Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty tried to share what he and other Republicans learned from President William Jefferson Clinton’s impeachment in the late 1990s. After we are done with President Donald John Trump’s impeachment, perhaps McNulty will have a follow-up article on “lessons not learned.” In case he does not get to it, here is a short attempt. //In an essay entitled “Passions, Politics and the Removal of a President: Lessons Learned from the Impeachment of President Clinton,” which appeared in Grove City College’s Journal of Law & Public Policy, former Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty tried to share what he and other Republicans learned from President William Jefferson Clinton’s impeachment in the late 1990s. After we are done with President Donald John Trump’s impeachment, perhaps McNulty will have a follow-up article on “lessons not learned.” In case he does not get to it, here is a short attempt. //Hon. Paul McNulty reflected on the lessons learned from Clinton's impeachment in an essay in the ... [+] Journal of Law & Public Policy of Grove City College. Picture from a past Congressional discussion (Photo By Douglas Graham/Roll Call/Getty Images)//Before joining the Department of Justice and later becoming President of Grove City College, McNulty worked in the House of Representatives for ten years, including as Chief Counsel and Director of Legislative Operations for House Majority Leader Henry Hyde. He served as Chief Counsel and Director of Communications for the Clinton impeachment proceedings. //Numerous scholars and pundits have argued that, ideally, presidential impeachments should not be partisan efforts. Nevertheless, just Henry Hyde decided to go ahead with the process against Bill Clinton, Nancy Pelosi decided to go forward with impeachment against Donald Trump despite near-unanimous opposition from President Trump’s party. It is clear now that the main lesson McNulty wanted to teach in his article was not heeded: “Congressional leaders should follow the example set by Henry Hyde and steadfastly avoid appearing to use impeachment to settle political scores or damage the president’s standing with the American public.”//For Henry Hyde, the question was Clinton’s “lying under oath.” As he said, “Perjury and obstruction of justice cannot be reconciled with the office of the President of the United States.” In Trump’s case, the charges are abuse of power and obstruction of justice. I will not go into the case as readers of this publication have plenty of other writers and articles at their disposal. I will just note a few political and economic aspects.//Given the political nature of the impeachment, both sides have been anxious to find any sign or trend in public opinion in order to maximize the political gains of their decisions. By contrast, there has not been a strong tide either way in public opinion. I follow Western newspapers and magazines, but given the widely held opinion that the end result would be acquittal, news about the impeachment did not garner much attention. Foreigners can recall the results of the Clinton impeachment so, therefore, the current impeachment does not affect most of them enough to warrant spending much time or thought on what, for them, is a non-topic.  The subtitle of the latest Economist piece on impeachment (January 25, 2020) reads: “In the fight between Donald Trump and impeachment, impeachment is coming off worse.” Readers will note The Economist seldom has anything good to say about President Trump or his policies. //Given the performance of the economy under President Trump, including record low unemployment and rising incomes for the middle class and the poorer segments of the economy, one can imagine several Democrats being convinced that they had little to lose by trying the impeachment route. Some saw it as the only way to defeat Trump in 2020, if not by removal then at least by weakening his candidacy. Although there are many differences between the famous “blue dress” and the transcripts of Trump’s phone call, the recent discussions about John Bolton’s book – and the potential of calling Bolton, Hunter Biden, and others as witnesses – have created a climate similar to the one that existed when Congress was debating whether to release the Starr report. //No more time for laughs? Picture from August 20, U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to members of ... [+] the media as National Security Adviser John Bolton listens during a meeting with President of Romania Klaus Iohannis in the Oval Office of the White House August 20, 2019 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)//Starr’s lengthy report contained salacious material and many did not want it released. Nevertheless, as some of us recall and as McNulty writes, “Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and senior Democrats” decided to release it. Some were baffled that the Democrats wanted the report to be released. Many were likewise surprised that President Trump released the transcript of the phone call which was the basis of the current impeachment. Some legislators considered having Monica Lewinsky testify in order to shift public opinion but, as McNulty writes, decided not to, as “they judged it would be an undignified spectacle.”//Early last year, Paul J. McNulty reflected on his experience during the impeachment of President ... [+] Clinton, in Volume 10 of the Journal of Law and Public Policy of Grove City College //As the goal now seems to be how best to sway voters in the 2020 elections, all these calculations about what to release or what further witnesses to call, if any, become more relevant with regard to swing districts and independent swing voters. Most Democrats and Republicans are already set in their views regarding impeachment, so all eyes go to how voters in these districts are reacting to the latest news.   //McNulty concludes his piece with a quote from a Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee: “The impeachment of a President was reserved by the Framers of the Constitution for only the most severe threats against the nation and our system of government. It exists as a remedy to prevent the President from becoming a tyrant. It should not be used for mere partisan purposes to overturn the will of the people as expressed in two national elections.” //In Trump’s case, the large majority of Republicans see the impeachment as an effort to overturn one, or perhaps two, national elections. Some Democratic legislators have hinted that if Trump wins and they continue to control the House of Representatives, they will continue to impeach the president.//In these columns I usually focus on policy and the economy, but I have frequently mentioned how, although it is hard to measure, the battle of the entrenched bureaucracy and special interests against President Trump and his policies creates uncertainty and have a negative impact on investment decisions. What can create more uncertainty than impeachment? //The impeachment, however, did not come as a surprise: Soon after the Republicans lost Congress in 2018, many in the administration were bracing for it. I recall an off-the-record presentation at that time by chief-of-staff Mick Mulvaney where he mentioned that he too, like McNulty, had seen the Clinton impeachment process from the inside and saw that “if we did it to them, they will do it to us.” //Stock market and economy performance during the impeachment inquiry and trial of President Donald ... [+] Trump//Throughout all this process, however, the stock market has not shown any pattern of reaction at any step of the impeachment process. The Dow Jones is now 6.7% higher than when the impeachment inquiry started on September 24, 2019. It was even higher on January 15 and January 22, 2020, when Congress delivered the articles of impeachment and the Senate initiated the trial. Stocks have reacted to the coronavirus, trade battles, interest rate changes, and so on – but not to impeachment news and revelations. GDP growth has remained almost unchanged during these last three quarters. Almost no one is readjusting investment portfolios expecting that the impeachment will end with removal and a potential reversal of economic policies. //It seems that the markets, unlike politicians, learned the lessons from Clinton’s impeachment. The market expected something and knows how it will end. The final word should come with the next presidential elections – but those of us who have studied history know that nothing guarantees that politicians will not make the same mistakes twice. //", 4.9%

It’s not even January yet, conference play has just begun and coaches aren’t focused on the NCAA Tournament quite yet.//But here are the facts. Since Michigan State won the conference’s last title in 2000, here’s how the 19 NCAA championships have been divided up (there was no NCAA Tournament in 2020 due to the pandemic://ACC - 8//Big East - 6//SEC - 3//Big 12 - 1//American - 1////For what it’s worth, the Pac-12 hasn’t won an NCAA title since Arizona in 1997.//Izzo, now 65, knows all too well about the futility of the Big Ten on the biggest of stages.//With Michigan State's loss to Texas Tech in the 2019 Final Four, Izzo walked away from his eighth Final Four appearance with just one NCAA championship.//“We didn't get it done," Izzo said then. “I feel like I'm part of that issue, so I'll put on my big boy pants and say, yeah, you've been here eight times, you've won one, so that's part of the problem.”//Unbeaten and No. 1 Gonzaga of the WCC looks like the heavy favorite to cut down the nets in April, while No. 2 Baylor (Big 12), No. 3 Villanova (Big East) and No. 4 Kansas (Big 12) are all top contenders. //For what it’s worth, Iona’s Rick Pitino, who has won NCAA titles at Kentucky and Louisville, doesn’t think the Big Ten needs to win a title to justify the hype.//“No they don’t,” he said. “The conference is extremely strong but Gonzaga and Baylor are the two strongest teams in the country by far early on.//“A one-game match in the NCAA Tournament doesn’t determine the strength of the league. It’s a really strong league with 6-7 terrific teams but none in the class with Gonzaga or Baylor.”//Izzo, whose team is 0-3 in the Big Ten for the first time since 2001-2, still wants to see his conference win another title. //“One of these days,” he said in 2019, “we've got enough teams knocking on the door, we're going to find a way to win one.”//", 14.3%

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., listens during the second of ... [+] two Democratic presidential primary debates hosted by CNN Wednesday, July 31, 2019, in the Fox Theatre in Detroit. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)//For all the post-debate discussion of Barack Obama’s place in the 2020 Democratic presidential field – is it still fashionable to revere Obamacare; is there a contender other than Joe Biden willing to embrace Donald Trump’s predecessor? – there is this question: where’s Bill Clinton amidst his party’s conversation about tactics and ideological necessity?//Not that the 42nd President of the United States should be front and center on the debate stage – though I would pay good money to see him strike up a conversation with New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who shamelessly tossed him under the #metoo bus back in 2017 so as to advance her subatomic presidential prospects.//Maybe the candidates suffer from memory loss. Clinton’s been out of office for nearly 20 years now. Besides, to the extent that the Democratic torch was passed (laterally, not generationally), it was dropped by his wife in the 2016 election when her campaign’s incompetence gifted the election to Trump.//Still, it’s worth revisiting Clinton for at least two reasons.//Does the party wish it had a downsized field like the one in 1992 that made Clinton’s ascent all the easier?//Is there a Democrat in this race with his campaign chops?//About that first of the four Clinton runs by husband and wife: by the time of 1992’s first primaries, the field was down to five main candidates – Clinton, former California Gov. Jerry Brown, then-Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, then-Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey and former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas.//Two of those candidates were regional (Harkin and Tsongas – though Tsongas did carry six other states). A third never caught fire (Kerrey).//That left it to Clinton and Brown, who had been out of office for a decade and wouldn't return to California’s state capital until the next century.//The highlight of their differences: Brown questioning Hillary Clinton’s ethical choices as a Little Rock attorney and her firm’s cozy ties to the Arkansas state government (it turns out he was on to something).//Because the party’s biggest names took a pass on that election, the Democratic primaries didn’t offer much in the way of a deep policy talk. And because there wasn’t a liberal lion the likes of the late Mario Cuomo to challenge Clinton’s “triangulation” approach to appeasing both left-of-center and right-of-center voters, there wasn’t much talk about the party’s direction (back in 1992, Clinton could easily have been put on the hot seat over his support of free trade and welfare reform).//That’s not the case in 2020 – and it could kill the Democrats’ chances of unseating Trump.//To the extent there’s one candidate playing the Clinton card of electability, it’s Biden. However, the former vice president has to figure to how position himself via a vis at least two ideas coming from the left that potentially are poison at the polling booths.//That would be the notions of cash reparations for slavery (a June-July Gallup Poll showed 67% of Americans opposing government payments to slave descendants) and socialized medicine in the form of Medicare-for-All (Bernie Sanders’ embrace of Canadian healthcare beckons a check-up from the neck-up for the Vermint senator – however, it’s typically a four-week wait for a CT scan north of the border).//The list of “good-luck explaining that in Deer Hunter Country” stances is mind-boggling. Illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border should be decriminalized. Candidates, if they could, would go back in time and embrace forced busing of schoolkids.//As for the “commander-in-chief test,” Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren apparently has an aversion to the first-strike use of nuclear weapons. Those World War II veterans who made the voyage back to America, as opposed to dying in an invasion of the Japanese homeland, may disagree.//But even if Biden somehow manages to slalom past these liberal obstacles (and he still has a lead ahead of the field), there’s another question moving forward: does he have what it takes to win a national election?//If you read the reviews from Wednesday’s debate, Biden gets credit for a better performance than his first encounter with his rivals back in June.//That’s faint praise . . . for clearing a low bar.//Biden still made plenty of gaffes (I don’t care much about his slip of the tongue in which he confusingly listed his text number, but apparently “Mayor Pete” has tried to capitalize on the mistake). There was no moment when Biden put a rival in their place (former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, who had the nerve to tangle with Biden on immigration and border policy, would be a good place to start). //What I’d worry about if I were a Biden adviser: is this the candidate’s peak performance, or is there room for improvement?//Can Biden offer a clear vision of where he wants to take the country, or is the raison d’etre of his campaign going to remain the promise of a national mental health break after four years of “Trump Derangement Syndrome”?//Maybe Biden’s right and the ticket to ousting Trump is to convince enough Americans living in the lands of 270 electoral votes that another four years of the daily rollercoaster ride that is the Trump presidency is too much emotional wear and tear for the national to endure. Then again, that sorta sounds like the losing Clinton strategy in 2016.//Meanwhile, missing from this, the third Biden presidential run (he tried and failed in 1988 and 2008), is what’s worked well for Democrats in past elections: the notion of the right man, generationally, at the right moment.//John Kennedy was 43 when he won the presidency in 1960. His World War II generation succeeded Eisenhower’s World War I generation (that was the first of two wars Ike fought, just two years after he graduated from West Point).//Bill Clinton was 46 when he won the presidency in 1992. He didn’t go to Vietnam, but George H.W. Bush did go to war in the Pacific. The age difference: 22 years.//Barack Obama was 47 when he won the presidency in 2008. Unlike George W. Bush’s and John McCain’s Vietnam-era generation, Obama’s peers didn’t come of age in a hot war.//Joe Biden turns 77 in November. Will America turn to one septuagenarian to oust the other? If the winning strategy is offering Americans a dose of political Xanax, shouldn’t it come from someone a little more inspirational and not as wedded to the political system as Biden (a combined 40 years as a Delaware senator and Obama’s sidekick)?//It’s something for Team Biden to ponder until the next debate, which mercifully isn’t until September. How to make Biden seem the man of the moment – and how to minimize those moments when the candidate is hardly the voice of intellectual and generational brio.//I invite you to follow me on Twitter: @hooverwhalen//", 7.9%

(Jun-Lyn Fontanilla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.) Epstein was convicted of state prostitution charges in June 2008, and was released from prison in August 2009 to a year of house arrest, which included trips to his Manhattan mansion and private island.//Tangent: Epstein was known for wearing Harvard sweatshirts (and was photographed in them multiple times) even though he never went there and had no formal relationship with the university. He did donate millions to Harvard, which has no plans to return the money—which continues to create tension at the university (a Harvard Crimson editorial urged Harvard to “critically evaluate the full extent of its relationship with Epstein, considering not only the millions of dollars that he directly gave to the University and its affiliates, but also the relationships he forged with University faculty”). He also socialized with Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, who helped negotiate Epstein’s highly criticized 2008 plea deal.//Key background: The Epstein scandal has plagued Prince Andrew for years. After striking up a friendship with Epstein, Prince Andrew stayed at many of Epstein’s properties and flew on Epstein’s private jet, nicknamed the “Lolita Express.” When Epstein’s payment to Ferguson became publicly known in 2011, she publicly apologized for accepting his money. Prince Andrew resigned from his role as trade envoy for the British Foreign Office as part of the fallout. //", 2.9%

"Bill Clinton Speaks At 'Swell By Ripple' As Regulatory Concerns Grow", "Getty//Getty//Former U.S. President Bill Clinton took the stage as the keynote speaker at the Swell Conference hosted by Ripple yesterday and spoke about the development of blockchain technology and the regulatory environment around the emerging technology. //The Swell Conference focuses on bringing together payment, technology, and policy experts in the global payments industry. The conference comes with Ripple’s official xRapid product launch, as a tool for removing pre-funded nostro accounts for cross-border payments and sourcing liquidity - all through the XRP digital asset on global exchanges. //The annual event is hosted by Ripple and attracts blockchain experts from around the world. Taking place in San Francisco this year, this is the second Swell Conference following the inaugural conference in Toronto last year. //Bill Clinton was slated as the keynote speaker this year, and he touched on a variety of topics. Specifically, Clinton referenced his time as president during the emergence of the Internet and how there is an initial disparity of access, to such novel technologies that need to be overcome. He stated: //"The more you develop new technologies like blockchain … AI technologies, robotic technologies … the more the disparity of access is going to be felt."//He continues to go on citing that it is necessary to take a cautious approach to the regulation of innovative technologies, while maintaining an openness to them, continuing://"..you can't apply an old regulatory regime to a new technology...” //He continues://“You end up killing the goose that laid the golden egg."//Clinton’s remarks, while joined by former advisor and current Ripple board member Gene Sperling, come at a time where compliance issues and the uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S. have come to the forefront of debate. //The uncertain regulatory environment is particularly relevant to the host of the Swell Conference, Ripple. //Ripple has taken a friendly approach to the legacy financial system with a suite of products including xCurrent and xRapid explicitly tailored for banks, payment providers and money remittance services. However, they have had to repeatedly refute that their XRP digital asset should be classified as a security token, even going as far as to hire two former SEC officials in a lawsuit claiming that XRP is a security. //Ripple’s battle for the classification of its XRP digital asset is not the only high-profile case of problems, stemming from regulatory uncertainty in the broader cryptocurrency field in the U.S. //A complete lack of clarity from the IRS has led to calls from multiple sources including both lawmakers and industry executives to provide comprehensive transparency and guidelines for taxpayers on crypto assets. //Further, the SEC’s hesitancy to provide definitive rules for ICOs and cryptocurrencies outside of references to Bitcoin and Ether and a general statement from the end of last year has led to frustrations among the wider community. The SEC has also repeatedly denied proposals for Bitcoin ETFs, citing a lack of exposure and investor protections.   //The uncertain regulatory environment has also led to the rise of blockchain havens such as Malta where the government recently passed several laws providing a legal framework for blockchains and cryptocurrencies in the country. Maltese PM, Joseph Muscat, even recently hailed cryptocurrencies as the “future of money” in a speech at the UN General Assembly. //The fears around the uncertain regulation of cryptocurrency assets primarily originate from a concern over potential over-regulation. A tempered approach to the development of the Internet under Bill Clinton helped shape the technology’s success, so this why his remarks bear significance. //Potential over-regulation of the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector could push innovation outside of the U.S. and into other areas, particularly Asia. //“While some degree of oversight is necessary, heavy-handed regulations in blockchain will not only stifle innovation, but shift it internationally away from the United States who risk being left behind in the blockchain revolution," tells me Seth Hornby, CEO at Zenchain on the manner, "In many cases, regulations are causing material harm to the investors they seek to protect, with many ICOs forced to reduce the value of their tokens by removing dividends, token burns and similar features – for fear of being otherwise deemed a security.”//Michael Arrington, the TechCrunch founder and current partner at Arrington XRP Capital, has referenced the consequences of a second subpoena that they received as his fund halting token investments in U.S. companies until the SEC clarifies token rules.//“Before the SEC began to enforce its strict regulations, America was clearly in the lead when it came to innovation and most importantly, exchange volume," says  Han Yoon, CEO of Lunar Digital Assets.//"By over-regulating these exchanges instead of taxing them, hundreds of millions of dollars in potential tax revenue have left the United States and into other countries, with Chinese exchanges taking the lead by far. This trend is ongoing and even accelerating, as we have personally seen hundreds of American startups leave the United States because of the legal uncertainties, incorporating in places like the Cayman Islands, Malta, Estonia, and others."//These statements correlate to a strong and growing sentiment within the U.S. about the need for a clearly defined regulatory framework in regards to digital assets. //Fostering a friendly environment, or at least simply providing more clarity, would go a long way in reassuring American investors, institutions, developers and companies that they will not be sideswiped by unfavorable regulations. Bill Clinton’s remarks are in tune with broader industry sentiment, and it is essential to take into account the repercussions of negatively impacting the development of technologies with such vast potential as blockchains and cryptocurrencies. //As the concerns surrounding compliance and regulation continue to evolve, the mounting pressure on the SEC and IRS should force their hand into providing the necessary clarity on the state of digital assets in the United States moving forward. //", 10.0%

And much later, perhaps after you’re dead, something grows from what you’ve done.  –Rumi//Bill Clinton still needs the spotlight, but he now seems weighed down by it--especially in recent days which have seen him evading responsibility for past indiscretions and by seeming to portray himself as a victim amidst it all.//Bill Clinton is now a novelist too. But how will history judge him as a leader? (Photo by Slaven... [+] Vlasic/Getty Images)//Even though his dwindling supporters and many of his critics agree he's been the most skilled American politician of his era, he's unable to rescue the brightest parts of his legacy, even as he takes on a new career as a novelist.//So how should we judge Clinton today—and will history judge him as enthusiastically and admiringly as he so desperately wants to be judged?//We all know about his remarkable strengths and his legendary weaknesses. But let’s consider luck and circumstance, and how a leader responds to them.//As president, Clinton was lucky in some ways--for instance, to inherit favorable economic tailwinds. He was unlucky in other ways, such as the level of fierce, well-organized opposition to him personally. He handled some of that masterfully and some miserably.//I liked Clinton a good deal. But when the Lewinsky saga descended on our nation, I found myself feeling deep down that a great leader—whether rightly or wrongly accused—would resign and willingly exit the stage, taking the stain of the accusations with them in order to allow their country and their party to both move forward.//Let’s face it, if Al Gore had been the sitting president in 2000 as a “Clinton without the blue dress,” he’d probably have won reelection that year, and American history would have gone in a direction that’s more in tune with Clinton’s own political values. But if Clinton didn’t quite place himself above his nation, he did attempt to fuse the two.//About six years ago, you could argue that his strategy—to refuse to repent or to retreat or to admit defeat—had been vindicated. Clinton was the story of the 2012 Democratic National Convention, galvanizing support for President Obama’s reelection. Everyone, admirers included, accepted that he was a flawed, failing person, but he was still hailed as someone who triumphed over an unfair and unruly mob. And he was lauded for having the “it” factor that his wife lacked as a national politician.//As late as the middle of 2016, as he prepared to speak on behalf of Hillary at the party convention, pundits noted he enjoyed rare political popularity in our polarized times.//But the fates shuffled the deck, as they tend to do. By that fall, many more people were unwilling to overlook his past indiscretions any longer. #MeToo was nascent. And the left (exemplified by Bernie Sanders’ base) was turning on mainstream Democratic leaders. Clinton was an increasingly marginal “neoliberal,” whatever that is.//Clinton’s critics on the right never believed that he overhauled the budget and the economy. Now his leftist critics joined them, suggesting that he merely employed blue smoke and mirrors to create a façade of a strong economy. Clinton had achieved the impossible in getting both the left and right to blame him at least as much as George W. Bush for the 2008 global economic collapse.//So here’s the funny upshot for Clinton and for any leader worried about controlling their legacy: You can’t control it or micromanage it.//That’s because the rest of the world is using the various facts, rumors and allegations of your life to come up with its own story about what’s good and bad and what matters and doesn’t matter. That discussion will continue and change over time, as some issues take on greater urgency and other ones recede in importance. You may well be in your grave while the conversation and your reputation keep morphing. They may build a statue of you, then a later generation (or even the current one!) will decide that decency demands it be torn down.//And so it will be with Clinton. What are the big facts of his career? What are the terms of debate that determine whether he gets a statue or lives forever in ignominy?//It’s not for the leader or their followers to decide.//That at some level should be a relief. You're liberated as a leader from what you can't control.//Leadership guru Warren Bennis was right when he said that unhealthy leaders are obsessed with proving themselves, while healthy leaders are happy just to express themselves.//Just do what you need to do, then go home. Don’t analyze or agonize over what you did and how much it’s being appreciated. It's the only way a leader can ever be at peace with their careers. But unfortunately, it's not the Clinton way.//", 16.6%
