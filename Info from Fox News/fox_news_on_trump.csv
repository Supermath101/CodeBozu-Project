Once a media darling and lauded as a supposedly principled conservative outfit, its influence and fundraising have waned in 2021 after a 2020 that was so successful, its co-founders had designs on creating one of the world's largest media companies.//"I always thought it was a grift," Girdusky told Fox News Digital. "It's people desperately hungry for money, attention, and influence. The sad thing is they still have some relevancy." //
(photo: Fox News)//A year later, it's still operational and has a noisy social media presence boosting Democrats and shredding Republicans, but many of its original members are gone and critical of their former organization. Its cable news mentions have sharply declined, its involvement in the most prominent election of the year was a disaster, and when one of its senior advisors went on "The View" in November, she wasn't even identified on the program as part of the group. //AD BY FORMER LINCOLN PROJECT CEO COMPARING JAN. 6 TO NAZI BEER HALL PUTSCH DRAWS FIRE//When co-founder Rick Wilson admitted late last year he wanted Trump to be the 2024 Republican nominee again, despite the group's opinion he was an unquestioned threat to the country's security, he was put on the defensive as the "scam PAC" accusations began to flow again.//"I don't think these are people who want to go softly into the sunset," Girdusky said. "These are people who love attention and who love the game of politics. It's very addictive to be in this business … None of them can go back into Republican politics, and very few of them would be welcomed in Democratic politics, so they have to milk this for as long as they can."//Girdusky's piece published last Jan. 11 was just the tip of the iceberg about Weaver, as subsequent reporting showed his co-founders were aware of the accusations of harassing young gay men months before they let on; one of the people Weaver contacted was 14 when they first communicated online. Weaver would dangle job opportunities and social media clout while making suggestive and explicit remarks that left his victims uncomfortable and isolated.//THE LINCOLN PROJECT'S SPECTACULAR DOWNFALL: A TIMELINE//Weaver was condemned by his co-founders and resigned last year, but things only got worse, as a flood of stories ensued about the organization's self-dealing and financial mismanagement – the Lincoln Project paid $27 million alone to co-founder Reed Galen's consulting firm in 2020 – and a toxic work environment. Co-founder Steve Schmidt was widely panned when he said he would open the group's books for audit when the Trump organization did, and it was later revealed he ordered Kurt Bardella, now a Democratic advisor who resigned the group and called for it disband, to publish the private messages of co-founder Jennifer Horn with a reporter to try to embarrass her.//Former Lincoln Project executive director Sarah Lenti, now a sharp critic of the organization, said things were crumbling internally well before the Weaver story came to light. By the time four of its co-founders – including Weaver – gathered at Schmidt's home shortly before Election Day 2020 with dreams of creating a media empire, according to the New York Times, others in the organization felt cut out of the loop.//FORMER LINCOLN PROJECT ADVISOR TOM NICHOLS MOCKS AMERICANS CONCERNED ABOUT INFLATION, HIGH GAS PRICES//"Things were going downhill prior to election night," Lenti told Fox News Digital. "There were things happening internally that showed real division within the organization … The whole thing had become very self-serving."//She likened it to a family "on the brink of divorce."//The bad headlines took their toll after the group received media adoration in 2020 for taking on Trump, frequently getting their ads promoted on CNN, MSNBC, and elsewhere, and even getting a gushy "60 Minutes" profile. On CNN, it was mentioned just 49 times in 2021, versus 157 times in 2020 according to a Grabien Media search, including reruns.//
(MSNBC / CBS)//On MSNBC, the difference was even more stark. In 2020, where it received consistently adoring coverage from hosts like Nicolle Wallace and Brian Williams, it was mentioned a whopping 956 times. In 2021, that fell to 285, more than a third of which came in January alone, though it continued to receive promotion of its anti-Republican ads from Williams and Wallace.//A fundraising drop was to be expected in a non-election year, but the Lincoln Project went from raising nearly $90 million in 2020 to just $12.1 million in the first half of 2021 according to federal filings – it hasn't reported its second-half earnings yet. //DEMOCRATS, ‘NEVER TRUMPERS’ TURNING ON ‘INEFFECTIVE’ LINCOLN PROJECT: POLITICO//The attention paid to the group in October and November was considerably negative, as it took responsibility for a spectacularly failed political stunt in the closely watched Virginia governor's race. //The Lincoln Project went all out to defeat Republican Glenn Youngkin, depicting him as a closet racist running a divisive, "southern strategy" campaign. No one was prepared for how far it would go to try to make that label stick, however.  //The group dispatched five tiki-torch wielding people to stand in front of Republican Glenn Youngkin's bus in Charlottesville just days before Election Day, in an effort to conjure up imagery of the infamous White nationalist rally there in 2017. It took responsibility for the stunt after the images of the supposed Youngkin supporters went viral, and many people suspected a hoax. Democrat Terry McAuliffe's campaign condemned the smear effort after the Lincoln Project fessed up, but by then some of McAuliffe's own staffers and even some liberal media members had spread the pictures as supposed proof that Youngkin's campaign attracted racists.//THE LINCOLN PROJECT ROASTED AS ‘DERANGED HACKS’ FOR ORCHESTRATING VIRAL HOAX TO SMEAR YOUNGKIN//The stunt was widely panned as desperate and hamfisted; even Schmidt called it "recklessly stupid" in a subsequent interview and distanced himself from any involvement. Lincoln Project advisor Stuart Stevens tried to defend it in a CNN interview, saying it was part of an effort to hit Youngkin for not sufficiently condemning Trump for his rhetoric around Charlottesville. //

      (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)//Youngkin went on to defeat McAuliffe the following week, and the Lincoln Project weathered considerable mockery for the embarrassing distraction in the waning days of the race.//"They lost their minds," Lenti said.//A Politico report late last year summed up the group's woes: "But now, everyone keeps rolling their eyes at the Lincoln Project and fears they may be clearing a path for the former president’s reemergence … Operatives across the spectrum now say the group is, at best, ineffective and prodigal, at worst, counterproductive."//When Lincoln Project senior advisor Tara Setmayer appeared on "The View" in November, shortly after the election debacle, she was conspicuously not identified as a part of the group, either by co-hosts or on-screen graphics. //Instead, Setmayer, who hadn't worked in Congress since 2013, was labeled a former House GOP staffer.

Bush's administration, officially launched his bid to try and succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey in a race that could decide whether the Republicans win back the Senate majority in the midterms, top rival Dr. Mehmet Oz quickly criticized McCormick over his former hedge fund’s considerable investments in China.//McCormick, in an interview with Fox News Digital a couple of hours later, accused Oz and his campaign of "telling lies about me," urged his rival to "renounce" his dual citizenship with Turkey, and questioned why some of Oz’s merchandise was made in "Chinese factories."//PENNSYLVANIA GOP SENATE BATTLE: MCCORMICK JOINS CROWDED FIELD OF CONTENDERS//Even before McCormick’s campaign launch, a pro-Oz super PAC blasted him over Bridgewater Associates' major investments in China. McCormick joined the hedge fund behemoth a dozen years ago and helped steer Bridgewater Associates from 2017 through the end of last year. The fund has made major investments in China.//Ahead of McCormick’s announcement, a super PAC supporting Oz went up with digital ads charging, "David McCormick, he’s a friend — of China, with a long record of selling us out." The group, American Leadership Action, planned to start targeting McCormick with TV spots on Thursday.//And minutes after news broke of McCormick's entry into the race, Oz campaign manager Casey Contres charged that "Beijing’s favorite candidate David McCormick’s deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party aren’t just problematic, they are dangerous."//Oz, the well-known celebrity physician, cardiac surgeon, and author who until his campaign launch last month hosted TV’s popular "Dr. Oz Show," didn’t take direct aim at McCormick, but in an interview Thursday on Fox News’ "The Brian Kilmeade Show," argued that "our leaders have not been strong enough in declaring the extensional threat that China is to us."//LISTEN TO DR. OZ ON FOX NEWS' ‘THE BRIAN KILMEADE SHOW’//McCormick, in an opinion piece on FoxBusiness.com as he launched his campaign, vowed that if elected "I will do everything in my power to end our dependence on China, protect our communities and our jobs, counter their attempts to reshape the world in their authoritarian image, and ensure America remains the world’s unrivaled military and economic superpower."//And in an interview with Fox News Digital, McCormick touted that "my track record and my experience puts me in a great place to be a real strong force on China and essentially putting us in a much stronger position and really taking a much stronger posture on them."//And spotlighting his support for former President Donald Trump’s America First agenda, McCormick said "The truth is I’ve always been America First, since attending West Point and putting on the uniform to represent our country in combat. And for that reason I’m the best candidate to take on China, because I’ve fought before on the battlefield and in the boardroom."//MCCORMICK TAKES AIM AT CHINA IN FOX BUSINESS OP-ED//Many GOP candidates hoping for an endorsement by Trump – who remains very popular with Republican voters as he continues to play a kingmaker’s role in party politics and flirts with a 2024 White House run.

He’s pretending to be an outsider, but I can’t think of a more DC insider play than lying to benefit yourself," McCormick charged.//Responding, Oz campaign manager Contres told Fox News that McCormick "was raising funds for a third Chinese investment fund as recently as TWO months ago while he was already exploring a Senate run. His claims to being tough on China are a lie.//And the Oz campaign pointed towards a November Wall Street Journal report that McCormick's previous firm raised the equivalent of $1.25 billion for its third Chinese investment fund, boosting the hedge fund firm "into the ranks of the biggest foreign managers of private funds" in China.//McCormick, in his Fox News Digital interview, nodding to Oz’s dual citizenship that he holds with Turkey, also called "on Mehmet Oz to renounce his citizenship."//Oz, who as a dual citizen is legally permitted to serve in Congress, has indicated he has no intention of renouncing his Turkish citizenship. And Oz’s campaign has pointed to an opinion piece the candidate wrote in which he said he’s kept his Turkish citizenship to make it easier to visit family, including his mother, who lives in Istanbul and suffers from Alzheimer’s. In his op-ed, Oz also noted that he has "deep concerns about many of its (Turkey’s) authoritarian polices and harmful foreign policies."//SENATE GOP REELECTION ARM HAULS IN RECORD FUNDRAISING IN 2021//Oz has also highlighted China as he runs for the GOP Senate nomination and one of the top issues on his campaign website is getting "tough on China."//"Dr. Oz believes the United States has failed to respond to the global Chinese threat," the text reads.
