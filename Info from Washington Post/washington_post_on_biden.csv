Throughout the first year of Joe Biden’s presidency, Donald Trump was the name that must not be spoken.
As the former president solidified control over the Republican Party, spread lies about the 2020 election and teased another run for the White House in 2024, Democrats clamored for Biden to forcefully denounce Trump and use the power of his office to try to extinguish what they see as a singular threat to the future of the republic.
But Biden and his aides largely refused to talk about Trump or react to him, calculating that doing so might provoke Trump and risk elevating his standing by giving him and his rhetoric more media attention than they already have.
Inside the White House, meanwhile, the president and his team strategized about when and how to break his silence. They decided to do so, finally, Thursday, as the nation paused to mark the first anniversary of the deadly attack on the Capitol.

Speaking from the Capitol’s iconic Statuary Hall, which last Jan. 6 had been overrun by violent pro-Trump rioters, Biden unburdened himself from the norms of presidential deference and unleashed a torrent of attacks against his immediate predecessor. Though he did not call out Trump by name, Biden made 16 references to the “former president,” whom he squarely blamed for undermining America’s democracy.
“The former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election,” Biden said. “He’s done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interest as more important than his country’s interest and America’s interest, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution.”
Biden’s remarks do not mark a permanent shift in strategy about how to handle Trump, according to the president’s aides and allies. Rather, they said, Biden felt he had no choice but to directly address Trump’s culpability in the Capitol insurrection last Jan. 6 and the threat he poses to democracy.

“You can’t talk about what happened on January 6 without talking about the former president’s role in it,” Mike Donilon, a White House senior adviser, said in an interview. “There’s no way to be truthful about what happened there without doing that.”
Biden and his team also calculated that his speech at Thursday’s remembrance event would draw maximum media attention. Indeed, all three broadcast networks as well as Fox News Channel, which does not consistently air Biden’s speeches, carried his remarks live.
White House officials considered a range of options for how to commemorate Jan. 6, including whether Biden would just release a statement or give a more formal address. Aides considered holding an event in the White House to honor law enforcement officials who defended the Capitol before ultimately settling on sending Biden and Vice President Harris to the Capitol for a formal address.

Biden, who was deeply involved in the framing and writing of the speech, worked on it with advisers including Donilon; Jon Meacham, a historian who has advised Biden on messaging; and Vinay Reddy, the White House director of speechwriting.
Even as he assailed his predecessor, Biden tried to maintain a modicum of deference. Asked by reporters why he did not refer to Trump by name, Biden explained, “I did not want to turn it into a contemporary political battle between me and the president. It’s way beyond that.”
Aides said Biden only called Trump “the former president” because that is how he prefers to reference him. “He’s not inclined to talk about his predecessor by name,” said a senior White House official, who was only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity.
Biden also extended an olive branch to Republicans who have defied Trump’s calls to overturn the 2020 election results — such as Reps. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), both members of the House select committee investigating Jan. 6 —  calling them “courageous men and women.”

“Whatever my other disagreements are with Republicans who support the rule of law, and not the rule of a single man, I will always seek to work together with them to find shared solutions where possible,” he said. “Because when we have a shared belief in democracy, then anything is possible, anything.”
Trump had initially planned to hold a news conference Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, but he canceled it abruptly. He said he plans to address the events of Jan. 6 at a rally in Arizona next weekend.
Trump blasted Biden’s speech, suggesting the president was attempting to distract from the problems he has faced. Trump again falsely claimed Biden’s victory was “rigged,” although no evidence has been found of widespread voter fraud.
“Biden is working hard to try and deflect the incompetent job he is doing, and has done, on the horrible Afghanistan withdrawal (surrender), the Borders, COVID, Inflation, loss of Energy Independence, and much more,” Trump said in a written statement. “Everything he touches turns to failure. That’s what you get when you have a rigged Election.”

Many Democrats have been restless, wanting to see Biden denounce Trump’s subversion of democracy sooner, more forcefully and with repetition.
“I hope this moment does mark a turning point,” Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) said after Biden spoke. “We need to talk about Donald Trump, what his presidency meant for this country.”
Bush said Biden has a responsibility to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to speak out against Trump because more-vulnerable communities who have been active in protesting the former president are at risk from his agenda.
“I look forward to seeing how he pushes harder in making sure that we know that the former president who has the power, the authority to really set the tone for what happens in this country and abroad, what he did, so that we can help to change that,” she said.

Biden allies dismissed these concerns, however. House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) said the president was at “his finest hour” on Thursday, arguing that it is best to criticize Trump directly only at specific moments.
“I’ve heard people already, they tell me he should have given this speech six months ago,” he said. “Hell, no, he should not have. He should not have detracted from his infrastructure plan, from his rescue plan, from Build Back Better. That is putting too much of your emotions into this rather than dealing with political realities.”
Many Democrats also want to see Biden’s rhetoric matched by action, particularly as it relates to voting rights. The president said the country must be “unyielding in our defense of the right to vote” on Thursday, and he and Harris are scheduled to travel to Atlanta next Tuesday to speak about the need to pass voting rights legislation that has been held up in the Senate.

A coalition of voting rights groups in Georgia said Thursday that Biden and Harris should skip their trip to Atlanta unless they detail a concrete plan to pass voting rights legislation in Congress.
Nsé Ufot, chief executive of the New Georgia Project Action Fund, which focuses on registering voters and was part of the effort warning Biden about his trip, said the president has fallen short of his campaign promise to fight anti-democratic efforts.
“Not addressing this clear and present and direct threat on American elections is a fool’s errand,” she said. “It is a recipe for disaster. It is a concession and a pathway for Trump to return to the White House.”
Ufot said Biden has not adequately confronted the Republican Party’s efforts to roll back access to voting.
“What is happening in state legislatures across the country is dangerous and has the ability to destabilize government as we know it,” she said. “And I have yet to see the Biden administration act as if they understand the urgency of the moment that we‘re in.”

When Biden launched his presidential campaign in 2019, his message centered squarely on Trump and the threat he and many Democrats believed the then-president posed to the nation. Biden castigated Trump for his response to the deadly 2017 white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville.
As his campaign proceeded, Biden ratcheted up his rhetoric. He said Trump represented an “existential threat” to American democracy and later supported the House’s vote to impeach Trump for the first time by arguing Trump was “shooting holes in the Constitution.”
Former Ohio governor John Kasich, a Republican who crossed party lines to endorse Biden in 2020 because of the Democrat’s unity message, said he has been let down by the president’s inability to fulfill that promise.
“He ran as a conciliator, and he hasn’t been,” Kasich said. “End of story, and maybe he can change and become one.” He argued that Biden’s expansive liberal agenda has alienated large swaths of the country.
Biden’s aides said Thursday’s speech was a continuation of the themes that compelled Biden to run, with the president even repeating the slogan that was at the center of his campaign.
“I said it many times and it’s no more true or real than when we think about the events of January 6th: We are in a battle for the soul of America,” Biden said.
Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Jan. 6 select committee, said the threats to democracy extend beyond just Trump and now animate the Republican Party. Raskin said that Democrats, including Biden, must be clear about that.
“He certainly needs to be the leader in our opposition to fascistic politics in America,” Raskin said of Biden. “He laid down the gauntlet in his original campaign when he said that he decided to run when he saw what was taking place in Charlottesville. It was prescient.”
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who also sits on the Jan. 6 committee, said fellow Democrats should avoid amplifying Trump’s statements, but that the country cannot afford to fully ignore his words and actions. “If we look back years from now, having lost our democracy, people will wonder: How could we have missed such obvious signs?” he said. “How could we have missed him once again endorsing foreign leaders who are tearing down their democracies? And so as we‘ve seen so often in the past, when people tell you they’re going to do terrible things, you need to take them seriously, because particularly this former president is quite determined to do exactly that.”
Biden made clear on Thursday that he agreed. “I will stand in this breach,” he said. “I will defend this nation and allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of democracy.”
Before Donald Trump launched his war against energy-efficient appliances, incandescent lightbulbs were on their way out. Federal rules required retailers to take them off their shelves by 2020 and sell replacements that would save customers money and energy instead.
That transition didn’t happen. Now the Biden administration is working to reinstate those rules and a dozen other efficiency regulations weakened under the former president — an unglamorous but effective way to cut energy use and fight climate change. But the Energy Department faces delays, bureaucratic obstacles and a huge backlog of long-overdue standards affecting dozens of household appliances, threatening the government’s ability to slash greenhouse gas emissions.
The plodding pace of this work shows how complicated even incremental changes to national environmental policy can be. As of last month, 33 energy efficiency standards for home appliances and equipment including gas furnaces, freezers and clothes dryers are overdue for updates, the department said, after Trump officials failed to act on them for four years. As many as 30 more will come due by the end of Biden’s term.

If the administration updates all of them — which would encompass almost every product the federal government oversees — it could make a major dent in the nation’s emissions of heat-trapping gases that fuel global warming. By 2050, new efficiency standards could prevent up to 3 gigatons of carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere, the rough equivalent of closing between 13 and 25 coal-fired power plants, according to a 2020 report by the energy conservation group American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
These upgrades could also save average American households about $100 annually on their power bills by the end of this decade, the analysis found. And at a time when the Senate is split 50-50 and unable to agree on new climate laws, the administration can make these emissions cuts without legislation.
But the Energy Department, which is choking on a series of rules enacted under Trump, has done little to tighten outdated standards.
“Each month of delay is having consequences,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. “The agency is simply not acting with the urgency that the climate crisis deserves.”

Some industry groups are asking the Biden administration to let the weaker environmental rules stay on the books — or at least to delay their repeal. And others, such as natural gas producers, argue that the government should not adopt policies barring new appliances and equipment from burning fossil fuels.
After Biden signed an executive order in January 2021 directing agencies to review Trump-era rules that would obstruct his climate agenda, the Energy Department drew up a list of 13 regulations to revise. Although the president’s order called for this work to be completed by the end of last year, some of the planned rule changes are unfinished.
Along with the suspended rule requiring Americans to buy more energy-efficient lightbulbs, a Trump rule weakening standards for dishwashers and another creating a new class of less-efficient washing machines and clothes dryers remain in effect.

Energy Department spokeswoman Victoria Vinall said the department had finalized eight efficiency rules in the past year and is working to complete the remaining five.
“The department will continue to work with all parties to move these rules through the regulatory process,” she said.
In a letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm last month, environmental and consumer advocacy groups urged the department to move faster, writing that the climate benefits of stronger appliance standards are “too great for any further delay.”
The advocates stressed that before the department can address the backlog of outdated appliance efficiency standards, it has to wrestle with the Trump-era rules still blocking its way. Failing to rewrite these rules “will frustrate the progress of the entire [energy efficiency] program,” they warned.

Some of the biggest savings and emissions reductions would come from updating standards for the humble incandescent lightbulb, which Trump favored over more efficient bulbs he called “no good.”
“I always look orange,” he told Republican House members in 2019.
Each month that incandescent bulbs remain on the shelves equates to about 800,000 tons of preventable carbon dioxide emissions that enter the atmosphere over those products’ lifetime, according to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project.
Efficiency advocates and others familiar with DOE’s operations said several things account for the delays.
Some of the rules undoing the Trump-era regulations are held up at the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), a branch of the Office of Management and Budget. Both offices are understaffed, and neither has a Senate-confirmed leader, which has slowed the vetting of Biden’s proposed efficiency rules.

The Energy Department also isn’t facing a court-ordered deadline. When Barack Obama became president, the DOE had to move fast to comply with a judicial order in a lawsuit brought by 14 states and advocacy groups.
The department has made progress. It repealed the first of two Trump regulations that imposed new hurdles to setting stricter efficiency standards. And it reversed a rule that lifted limits on how much water could be used in a shower, which Trump complained about at a White House event in 2020.


“So shower heads — you take a shower, the water doesn’t come out,” Trump said then. “You want to wash your hands, the water doesn’t come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair — I don’t know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect.”

Last month, the department undid a rule that allowed retailers to continue selling less-efficient gas furnaces and water heaters. Now it will be able to set stricter standards, which could cut emissions from most households’ highest energy-using products.
In most of these cases, the Energy Department replaced the Trump-era regulations with rules that were previously in place — a simpler and less time-consuming process than writing new, tougher regulations.
Although manufacturers did not push for all of the Trump administration’s efficiency rollbacks, they are now fighting some of Biden’s initiatives.
The American Lighting Association, a trade group, has asked DOE to postpone fully implementing stricter lightbulb efficiency standards for two years. Commenting on the proposed rule in June, it warned that a faster pivot away from incandescent bulbs to energy-efficient LEDs would result in “major financial losses” for lighting manufacturers and retailers, as well as “a glut of stranded inventory, piling up at individual showrooms and eventually landfills.”

The American Public Gas Association, which represents gas utilities, argued that tougher standards for gas furnaces would make them unaffordable. David Schryver, the group’s president and CEO, said many Americans have already switched to furnaces that burn gas more efficiently, and that those who haven’t lack the money. Eliminating the older, less-expensive furnaces from the market could encourage buyers to turn away from gas entirely, he said, and toward electric heat pumps.
“If you impose this one-size-fits-all standard, you’re going to encourage fuel-switching,” Schryver said. “We’re certainly concerned about rulemakings that push people away from natural gas or have the effect of doing that.”
By law, the Energy Department is required to review efficiency standards every six years. But some of them have stayed in place for decades as previous administrations missed deadlines to write new ones.

The U.S. government hasn’t made significant changes to furnace efficiency requirements since its first one took effect in 1992. Furnaces using older technology that allow much of the heat produced to be lost up the flue are still widely available.
Water heater standards, meanwhile, haven’t changed since 2010. And although the Energy Department’s website boasts that LED bulbs use 75 percent less energy and last up to 25 times longer than incandescent lighting, the types of lightbulbs that can be sold today are the same as they were in 2014.
Efficiency advocates said they are concerned that if the administration takes years to restore the efficiency rules rolled back under Trump, manufacturers will have even more time to continue producing outdated appliances before they have to comply with the new standards. Gas-powered furnaces and water heaters sold today could last a decade or two before they need to be replaced, complicating the president’s goal of halving U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels.
“These efficiency standards are absolutely crucial, both to meeting our climate goals and to saving consumers money,” said Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “They need to get out the door and finalized as fast as possible.”
A federal judge granted a preliminary injunction on Monday blocking the Defense Department from taking action against a group of 35 Navy sailors who had refused to get a coronavirus vaccine, raising questions on how it might shape the Pentagon’s requirement that all U.S. troops get vaccinated.
U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor found that the pandemic “provides the government with no license to abrogate” the freedoms that any American has, and that the service members had a right to avoid getting a vaccination on religious grounds.
“This Court does not make light of COVID-19′s impact on the military. Collectively, our armed forces have lost over 80 lives to COVID-19 over the course of the pandemic,” O’Connor wrote Monday in a 26-page order.
But the judge added that the “loss of religious liberties outweighs any forthcoming harm to the Navy” and that “even the direst circumstances cannot justify the loss of constitutional rights.”

The troops — a group that included Navy SEALs and other members of Naval Special Warfare Command — filed suit against President Biden, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro and the Defense Department to challenge the Navy’s vaccination requirement in November. The troops cited Christian beliefs that they should not take a vaccine developed from aborted fetal cell lines and saw a modification of their bodies as an “affront to their Creator.” Many Christians have sought vaccination, with Pope Francis urging Catholics to do so on humanitarian grounds.
The suit was filed by First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit that specializes in defending religious liberty. Michael Berry, a lawyer for the institute, said in a phone interview that the ruling “sends a clear message to the Biden administration, to the Pentagon and to the Navy that our service members do not give up their religious freedom when they serve their country.”

Should the Biden administration appeal the decision, Berry said, “we will defend this as far as it needs to go.”
O’Connor noted that the Navy has a process by which service members can seek a religious accommodation to avoid vaccination but said that “by all accounts, it is theater.” Twenty-nine of the 35 troops represented in the lawsuit had seen their requests to avoid the vaccine denied, with many appealing, his ruling said.
“The Navy has not granted a religious exemption to any vaccine in recent memory,” O’Connor wrote. “It merely rubber stamps each denial.”
The injunction comes after nearly all of the more than 1 million active-duty U.S. service members received at least one coronavirus vaccination, and as the Defense Department has begun to end the military careers of those who do not. The Air Force and Marine Corps began administratively separating service members last month, while the Navy and Army were expected to begin doing so this month.
The Defense Department has seen numerous challenges since Austin mandated the vaccine in August, citing concerns about how the virus could affect the military’s readiness. The Pentagon has required other vaccinations for years, a point that senior defense officials have made repeatedly.
