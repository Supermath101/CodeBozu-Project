A federal judge granted a preliminary injunction on Monday blocking the Defense Department from taking action against a group of 35 Navy sailors who had refused to get a coronavirus vaccine, raising questions on how it might shape the Pentagon’s requirement that all U.S. troops get vaccinated.
U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor found that the pandemic “provides the government with no license to abrogate” the freedoms that any American has, and that the service members had a right to avoid getting a vaccination on religious grounds.
“This Court does not make light of COVID-19′s impact on the military. Collectively, our armed forces have lost over 80 lives to COVID-19 over the course of the pandemic,” O’Connor wrote Monday in a 26-page order.
But the judge added that the “loss of religious liberties outweighs any forthcoming harm to the Navy” and that “even the direst circumstances cannot justify the loss of constitutional rights.”

The troops — a group that included Navy SEALs and other members of Naval Special Warfare Command — filed suit against President Biden, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro and the Defense Department to challenge the Navy’s vaccination requirement in November. The troops cited Christian beliefs that they should not take a vaccine developed from aborted fetal cell lines and saw a modification of their bodies as an “affront to their Creator.” Many Christians have sought vaccination, with Pope Francis urging Catholics to do so on humanitarian grounds.
The suit was filed by First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit that specializes in defending religious liberty. Michael Berry, a lawyer for the institute, said in a phone interview that the ruling “sends a clear message to the Biden administration, to the Pentagon and to the Navy that our service members do not give up their religious freedom when they serve their country.”

Should the Biden administration appeal the decision, Berry said, “we will defend this as far as it needs to go.”
O’Connor noted that the Navy has a process by which service members can seek a religious accommodation to avoid vaccination but said that “by all accounts, it is theater.” Twenty-nine of the 35 troops represented in the lawsuit had seen their requests to avoid the vaccine denied, with many appealing, his ruling said.
“The Navy has not granted a religious exemption to any vaccine in recent memory,” O’Connor wrote. “It merely rubber stamps each denial.”
The injunction comes after nearly all of the more than 1 million active-duty U.S. service members received at least one coronavirus vaccination, and as the Defense Department has begun to end the military careers of those who do not. The Air Force and Marine Corps began administratively separating service members last month, while the Navy and Army were expected to begin doing so this month.
The Defense Department has seen numerous challenges since Austin mandated the vaccine in August, citing concerns about how the virus could affect the military’s readiness. The Pentagon has required other vaccinations for years, a point that senior defense officials have made repeatedly.
They never once spoke President Trump’s name. But as former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush discussed the highs and lows of the nation’s highest office during a joint appearance in Dallas, there were a few comments that certainly appeared to be thinly-veiled references to the current commander in chief.
The duo, who have appeared together numerous times over the years and often speak of their affinity and respect for one another, addressed a crowd of about 300 at a graduation ceremony for the Presidential Leadership Scholars program at the George W. Bush Presidential Library on Thursday, according to a Reuters report.
They talked about their friendship and common ground — “He was humble in victory, which is very important in dealing with other people,” Bush said of his predecessor in the White House, adding that he sometimes turned to Clinton for advice during his term.

Both men emphasized the importance of humility in the presidential role — a quality that the current president, who often publicly boasts of his triumphs and belittles his opponents, isn’t exactly known for. “I think the most important thing is to be humble, to listen, to realize everybody’s got a story,” Clinton said.
Then the 42nd president issued a bit of general advice — and perhaps something of a warning:
“If you want to be president, realize it’s about the people, not about you,” Clinton said, gesturing emphatically toward the audience. “And when it’s over — and that’s what a lot of these people who are real arrogant in office, they forget, time passes, and it passes more quickly than you know — you want to be able to say ‘people were better off when I quit, kids had a better future, things were coming together.’ You don’t want to say, ‘God, look at all the people I beat.’ ”
George W. Bush's presidency ended on a very sour note. His approval ratings dipped into the 20s as the Iraq war dragged on and the financial crisis hit. When Americans were electing his successor in November 2008, 7 in 10 of them disapproved of the outgoing incumbent.
This is how bad it was:


Eight years is a very, very long time in politics.
The latest Gallup poll, in fact, shows Bush with pretty strong image numbers, as politicians go these days. A majority -- 52 percent -- now view the former president favorably, while 43 percent view him unfavorably.
In fact, being out of the political game -- Bush is even sitting out this week's Republican National Convention in Cleveland and declining to back Donald Trump -- appears to be very good for his image.
How do we know that's likely the cause? Well, presidents historically have almost always seen their image improve after leaving office. Not being in the news or engaged in the heated political debates of the day makes people more nostalgic for you. They remember the good times and forget -- or at least forgive you for -- some of the bad.

Also proving that point? The fact that Bush is now about as popular as his predecessor, Bill Clinton.
As Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign has drawn on and her own numbers have dropped badly, the former president has seen his image take a hit too. A Quinnipiac University poll in May showed his favorable rating at 48 percent, while a CNN poll last month showed it at 51 percent -- down from a high of 66 percent as recently as 2014.

Bill Clinton's presidency, we would note, is generally much more well-regarded than Bush's. While Clinton certainly had his problems -- many of which are being rehashed even as I write this -- his presidency featured good economic times and is generally viewed as a success. During their second terms, Bush's average approval rating was 36.5 percent, per Gallup. Clinton's was 60.6 percent.
And yet, here we are in the heat of the 2016 campaign, and Americans (at least for now) view Bush about as positively as Clinton.
Let this be a lesson to you all: If you want to be liked, stay far, far away from politics -- and especially Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
