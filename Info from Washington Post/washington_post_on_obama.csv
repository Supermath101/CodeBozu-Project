Barack Obama’s speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston was an astonishing piece of oratory. It was also a bit of sleight of hand.
Then a U.S. Senate candidate from Illinois, Obama wove his personal ancestry and biography — black and white, Kenya and Kansas, Hawaii and Harvard — into the American story of opportunity, multiplicity and solidarity. Not red vs. blue, but united. Out of many, one. David Axelrod calls the address a love letter to America. “In no other country on Earth is my story even possible,” Obama declared, his most poignant line of the night.
Two words in that sentence would matter most. Throughout Obama’s time in the White House, his touchstone would not be that singular country on Earth, whose politics he was never able to bind together. Rather, it would be the man himself. My story. This was a presidency preoccupied with Obama’s exceptionalism as much as with America’s.

Modern presidents have often become conflated with the challenges and aspirations of their times. We speak of Richard Nixon’s silent majority, Jimmy Carter’s malaise, Ronald Reagan’s morning in America and George W. Bush’s wars. But with Obama, this personal identification has been compulsive, strategic and unceasing. In his 2006 manifesto, “The Audacity of Hope,” Obama called himself “a prisoner of my own biography,” yet throughout his presidency, biography would also empower him. Whether in foreign policy, race relations, electoral politics, or even in the meaning of the hope and change he promised, Obama has turned to his life and symbolism as a default reference and all-purpose governing tool.
The personalized presidency can be inspiring. It can also feel arrogant. And it can bypass some of the very norms and institutions Obama rhapsodizes about so frequently — a dangerous proposition as the country braces for an unpredictable, unmoored successor.

Biography plays a central role in all political campaigns, with candidates deploying their life stories to buttress their arguments. During Obama’s first presidential run, however, the story did not just strengthen the message — it became interchangeable with it. This was not by accident but by design. “Barack is the personification of his own message for this country, that we get past the things that divide us and focus on the things that unite us,” Axelrod, the campaign’s chief strategist, told the New York Times in 2007. “He is his own vision.”
So much so, in fact, that when President-elect Obama endured criticism for recycling Clinton-era officials into top posts, he argued that it didn’t matter, that he was enough. “I was never of the belief that the way you bring about change is to not hire anybody who knows how things work, and to start from scratch and completely reinvent the wheel,” Obama said to The Washington Post in January 2009. “I’m the one who brings change. It is my vision. It is my agenda.”
Turns out he was the change we had been waiting for.

His effort to improve relations with the Muslim world, for instance, was premised on the notion that his personal story could make a difference. In his speech at Cairo University in June 2009, the president said that a “new beginning” was possible in the troubled relationship. “Part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience,” he explained. He invoked his Kenyan family, with its generations of Muslims; recalled his childhood in Indonesia; and cited his work with Muslim communities in Chicago. His story was supposed to dispel foreign stereotypes of a self-interested, imperial United States and show that not all Americans shared apocalyptic visions of Islam.
Obama’s personal narrative is so flexible that he has cited it as proof of his empathy for Israel, too. As the president told the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg, he once interrupted Benjamin Netanyahu when he felt the Israeli prime minister was being condescending, lecturing him about the dangers Israel faced. “Bibi, you have to understand something,” the president said. “I’m the African American son of a single mother, and I live here, in this house. I live in the White House. I managed to get elected president of the United States. You think I don’t understand what you’re talking about, but I do.” (Tensions between the two leaders would endure throughout Obama’s presidency nonetheless, with an animus that was reportedly both substantive and personal.)

Everyone was supposed to fall under the sway of the Obamaness. As a candidate, Obama explained the logic. “I think that if you can tell people, ‘We have a president in the White House who still has a grandmother living in a hut on the shores of Lake Victoria and has a sister who’s half-Indonesian, married to a Chinese Canadian,’ then they’re going to think that he may have a better sense of what’s going on in our lives and in our country,” Obama told journalist James Traub in 2007. “And they’d be right.”

The Obama story would also surface around sensitive matters of national security. In a 2009 speech at the National Archives, the president stressed the importance of keeping America safe while upholding our laws and values, noting that the documents preserved in that building — the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights — were the foundation of liberty in America and a light for the world. And then, no surprise, it came back to him.
“I stand here today as someone whose own life was made possible by these documents. My father came to these shores in search of the promise that they offered. My mother made me rise before dawn to learn their truths when I lived as a child in a foreign land. My own American journey was paved by generations of citizens who gave meaning to those simple words — ‘to form a more perfect union.’ I’ve studied the Constitution as a student, I’ve taught it as a teacher, I’ve been bound by it as a lawyer and a legislator. I took an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution as commander in chief, and as a citizen, I know that we must never, ever, turn our back on its enduring principles for expedience sake.”
Over time, Obama would rely on that lawyerly background to render lofty principles more malleable, with a “don’t worry, it’s me” approach to national-security powers. When the New York Times described the president’s personal role in selecting terrorists (including a U.S. citizen) to target for attack, for example, it noted how “the control he exercises also appears to reflect Mr. Obama’s striking self-confidence: he believes, according to several people who have worked closely with him, that his own judgment should be brought to bear on strikes.” After not fully establishing the limits on such powers, Obama is turning them over to a new commander-in-chief with no less self-confidence and much less self-control.

Obama drew on the personal to address the revelations in 2013 about the National Security Agency’s electronic surveillance. After reassuring Americans on the extent of NSA oversight, he offered some unusual comfort. “I will leave this office at some point, sometime in the . . . next 31/2 years, and after that, I will be a private citizen,” Obama said. “And I suspect that, on a list of people who might be targeted so that somebody could read their emails or listen to their phone calls, I’d probably be pretty high on that list. It’s not as if I don’t have a personal interest in making sure my privacy is protected.”
So because Obama worries about his own future privacy, we should trust that he would never violate ours? That argument requires a generous helping of self-regard. Then again, as Henry Kissinger suggested recently, “Obama seems to think of himself not as a part of a political process, but as sui generis, a unique phenomenon with a unique capacity.” (And Kissinger seems like a guy who knows the feeling.)

Undoubtedly, it is in race relations that Obama’s personal story as the first black president has taken on the most salience. His political ascent became a source of post-racial dreams and incessant racist attacks, and rendered Obama an African American studies professor for the nation during what would become the Black Lives Matter era. In that role, his lectures leaned heavily on his biography.
When videos of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright’s sermons denouncing America threatened Obama’s presidential bid, the candidate drew upon his story to deliver the most memorable speech of the 2008 race. “I believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our time. . . unless we perfect our union by understanding that we may have different stories, but we hold common hopes; that we may not look the same and we may not have come from the same place, but we all want to move in the same direction,” he said at Philadelphia’s National Constitution Center. “. . . This belief comes from my unyielding faith in the decency and generosity of the American people. But it also comes from my own American story.”
Such faith may have been misplaced. Throughout his presidency, Obama staked so much on “a goodwill that his own personal history tells him exists in the larger country,” journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates argues in the latest Atlantic, adding that “only a black man with that same biography could underestimate his opposition’s resolve to destroy him.” Obama’s frequent calls for African American communities to take greater personal responsibility for their conditions, his preference for universal efforts to improve education and opportunity for all over targeted programs to help minority populations — these, too, reflect a trust forged through his particular experience.

[The ‘racial procrastination’ of Barack Obama]
The controversy surrounding Wright involved Obama’s faith and relationship with his former pastor, so the personal emphasis there was inevitable. But when Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman in central Florida in February 2012, Obama, evocatively yet unmistakably, brought the discussion back to himself again. “If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon,” the president remarked. After Zimmerman’s acquittal, Obama detailed the indignities and injustices black men face in America, explaining that such experiences informed how African Americans viewed that verdict. Then, as he often has, the president concluded by stressing the strides the country has made.
“Each successive generation seems to be making progress in changing attitudes when it comes to race,” Obama said. “It doesn’t mean we’re in a post-racial society. It doesn’t mean that racism is eliminated. But when I talk to Malia and Sasha, and I listen to their friends and I see them interact, they’re better than we are — they’re better than we were — on these issues.” It is noteworthy that he cited his family as evidence, an individualized benchmark of national self-improvement.

Similarly, when he spoke in 2014 on a grand jury’s decision to not indict Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson for killing Michael Brown, Obama reiterated that the nation was moving forward. “We have made enormous progress in race relations over the course of the past several decades,” he said. “I’ve witnessed that in my own life.”
In his recent book, “The Black Presidency: Barack Obama and the Politics of Race in America,” Michael Eric Dyson lingers over that moment. “Obama lauded the racial progress that he said he had witnessed ‘in my own life,’ substituting his body for our black bodies, his life for ours, and signaled again how his story of advancement was ours.” The problem, Dyson argues, is that despite his enormous symbolic power, Obama is an imperfect stand-in. “The ordinary black person possesses neither Obama’s protections against peril nor his triumphant trajectory that will continue long after he leaves office,” Dyson writes. “And Obama’s narrative does not answer a haunting question: If America can treat him as badly as it does . . . what will it do to the masses of Michael Browns in black communities?”

In multiple speeches, Obama has offered a distinct vision of American exceptionalism — that of a country constantly striving, sometimes struggling, to perfect itself. It is a process he interprets through his own story. In his 1995 memoir, “Dreams From My Father,” Obama tells of his hope that “the larger American community, black, white, and brown, could somehow redefine itself — I believed that it might, over time, admit the uniqueness of my own life.”
Perhaps, as president, Obama has turned so often to his story because of this belief that America was validating it. Or maybe because the inner circle of his 2008 campaign, the truest of true believers in the Obama story, exerted inordinate influence over his White House. Or perhaps Obama’s tendency fits our era of oversharing, self-obsession and first-person arguments.
Or it could be simply that he believes, as he argued in a 2006 speech on faith and politics, that Americans are missing “a narrative arc to their lives,” and he is supplying us with his own.
It certainly worked with voters when he was on the ballot. In both the 2008 and 2012 elections, Obama bested his opponents on the “cares about people like me” question in exit polls. But it was an appeal that remained with him alone. Indeed, one result of Obama’s personalized presidency is that his electoral fortunes far outshined those of the Democrats. After his two presidential victories, Democrats suffered sharp reversals in both midterms, and the party has seen its power diminished at all levels under Obama.
[The liberal war over the Obama legacy has already begun]
“Washington Democrats hated the White House for believing that the Obama brand and the Democratic Party brand were distinct, and that one was paramount over the other,” NBC’s Chuck Todd writes in “The Stranger: Barack Obama in the White House,” published in 2014. “The White House did little to dispel the notion that Obama came first, over and above the party.”
When Obama did inject himself into his party’s contests, he often emphasized his legacy. “I am not on the ballot this fall,” he stated in a speech on the economy delivered one month before the 2014 elections. “. . . But make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them.” At the time, the president was deeply unpopular in key states, and his personalization of the race did no favors to his party.
In this year’s presidential contest, Obama campaigned with more vigor and, at times, with arrogance. “I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election,” he urged a Congressional Black Caucus gathering. “You want to give me a good send-off? Go vote.”
That vote is now in, and the presidential candidate promising to dismantle the Obama legacy won, even while Obama still enjoys high approval ratings. Some voters who had cast their ballots for Obama, perhaps even twice, threw their support behind Donald Trump. “I don’t have an explanation for that, to put it bluntly,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest admitted.
The answer may not be so mysterious. Even in his party’s most crushing defeat, Obama remains popular because this presidency was less about particular federal programs, or the Democratic Party, or certainly Hillary Clinton, than about Obama himself.
They fall low, he goes high.

The man soon supplanting Obama in the Oval Office is even more enamored with his own story and more dismissive of his own party, and promises to remake the nation on the strength of his personality. “Nobody knows the system better than me,” Trump asserted at the Republican National Convention, “which is why I alone can fix it.” It is a more concentrated and insidious iteration of the personalized presidency.
Trump came to national political prominence on the back of “birther” lies — in essence, an effort to retroactively erase Obama’s story — and now seeks to unmake Obama’s legacy, too. A president who used his story in an attempt to uplift and empower is giving way to a leader for whom the office seems an exercise in personal brand extension.
[Donald Trump’s celebrity won him the White House. It could destroy his presidency.]
It is a far different ending than a captivating Illinois state senator may have imagined 12 years ago. The failure to fulfill that vision of a united America, or bring us closer to it, is now part of the Obama story, too.
“The spirit of national conciliation was more than the rhetorical pixie dust of Obama’s 2004 speech to the Democratic National Convention, in Boston, which had brought him to delirious national attention,” New Yorker editor and Obama biographer David Remnick wrote in 2014. “It was also an elemental component of his self-conception, his sense that he was uniquely suited to transcend ideology and the grubby battles of the day. Obama is defensive about this now.”
But a new battle is coming, and that defensiveness may prove useful. Trump’s vision for America threatens to make stories such as Obama’s less likely. Will this most self-referential of presidents retreat to speeches and memoirs, or will he fight to preserve the country that indeed made his story possible? What if that’s next — the Obama legacy no one saw coming, more about the nation than the man?
It would make for a great epilogue.

A literary guide to hating Barack Obama
How does Donald Trump stack up against American literature’s fictional dictators? Pretty well, actually.
Why reactionary nostalgia is stronger than liberal hope
Former president Barack Obama had a rough weekend. He announced on Instagram that Bo, the family dog, had died of cancer. Former first lady Michelle Obama explained that although originally intended for the girls, Bo was a companion to them, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. Losing that source of comfort can be wrenching.
In some ways, however, Barack Obama has also had a rough year. It is all the rage in 2021 to compare Obama’s first hundred days to Joe Biden’s. Both presidents entered the White House inheriting an economic mess from their predecessors. The passage of the American Rescue Plan (ARP), along with Biden’s ambitious plans for the future, has led to a lot of not-so-subtle talk suggesting that Biden is doing what Obama should have done when he was president.
Obama alums have noted that Biden’s ARP was considerably larger than the $800 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Biden has added to this theme, articulating in February the conventional wisdom about the ARRA: “It wasn’t quite big enough. It stemmed the crisis, but the recovery could have been faster and even bigger.”

There is a great deal of truth to Biden’s statement. The Obama administration decided to ask for less than $1 trillion because it believed anything larger than that would be rejected immediately by Republicans and moderate Democrats. In the end, the administration only got three GOP votes for the entire package. Little wonder that Democrats are concluding that Biden has been bolder in his first 100 days.
The thing is, hindsight is 20/20. As someone with some memory of what happened in 2009 and 2010, this retrospective take on Obama as cautious omits as much as it explains. As he notes in his memoirs, he was intent on earning bipartisan support for policy responses to the biggest economic crisis in a century. Traditionally, that had been how big policy initiatives had been crafted for decades. From the year 2021, one can look back at that view as naive, but it is worth remembering that the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) had passed just a few months earlier with bipartisan support.
Current observers are also underestimating the ideological opposition to large fiscal stimulus from a decade ago. Paul Krugman was one of the loudest voices pushing for a larger stimulus back in the day. As he noted back in 2010, conservative outlets were screaming in 2009 about the dangers of Keynesian expansionism. This was not far off the consensus among macroeconomics, which started producing austerian arguments as early as the spring of 2009.

The GOP was able to exploit this politically. Even though Republicans voted for TARP, they were able to lump it together with ARRA as examples of wasteful, profligate spending. The slow recovery from the 2008 financial crisis also helped to fuel the belief that the fiscal stimulus had not worked.
(It is easy in retrospect to dismiss the tea partyers as a bunch of political opportunists, but when they were first elected in 2010, they did try to impose austerity on government spending. It seemed like an authentic political movement, right up to the moment Donald Trump eviscerated whatever economic principles Republicans used to claim.)
The better retrospective take is that the United States has turned out to be more Keynesian than Europe in response to crisis. This would not necessarily have been what anyone expected in 2008. Nonetheless, even if it was smaller than optimal, the United States still engaged in a longer and stronger economic stimulus in 2009 and 2010 than other economies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It is therefore unsurprising that its economy performed better over the past decade.

The New York Times’s Peter S. Goodman noted last month that this divergence was playing out again between the United States and Europe:
Biden can afford to be bolder because the political and policymaking centers of gravity have shifted in the past 12 years. No one buys GOP concerns about either deficits or bipartisanship. The macroeconomic consensus on the costs and benefits of fiscal stimulus have shifted in a Keynesian direction. The surprise is that other countries have failed to move down a similar learning curve.
The point is, Obama faced a different ideational climate. It is precisely because of the lessons learned from what happened in 2009 that Biden can be more ambitious in 2021.
Former presidents long slipped into a life soaked in sepia. They farmed on bucolic homesteads with graceful names. They golfed. Eventually, inking memoirs became standard post-presidency practice, sometimes because they needed money, odd as that seems today.
“There is nothing more pathetic in life than a former president,” said John Quincy Adams, who went on to serve in the U.S. House for almost two decades after the White House.
“After the White House, what is there to do but drink?” asked Franklin Pierce, who did, prodigiously.
Other former presidents fared better. Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia. William Howard Taft became chief justice of the United States. Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter enjoyed more successful post-presidencies than their single terms in the White House.

The Clintons and the Obamas are forging decidedly different paths.
They launched foundations, libraries and museums, and global initiatives because this is what modern former presidents and first ladies do. But they’ve also become massive content creators. They live on our screens and in our ears and course through our social media feeds. They produce movies and television shows. This being 2021, they all host podcasts. The Clintons are penning his and hers thrillers to be published this year. The couples have partnered with such creative forces as Netflix, the History Channel, Apple, Spotify and Springsteen.
They all have Grammys. “American Factory,” produced by the Obamas’ company Higher Ground, earned the documentary feature Oscar last year; its “Crip Camp” is shortlisted this year.
They’ve become brands. And, frankly, they appear to be having a blast.


“Public policy, culture, and entertainment are all so intertwined these days,” Hillary Clinton wrote in an email, sent through her spokesman. “There are tremendous new opportunities across mediums to tell important stories and lift up the voices of people who have been quietly changing the world. And if, while I’m at it, I can have a little fun writing a mystery with my friend Louise Penny, all the better!”

“There is no playbook for a post-presidency like this,” says Katie Hill, the Obamas’ spokeswoman. “President and Mrs. Obama understood the power of storytelling. They used their unique perch to share the stories of people who inspired them.”
Both couples exited the White House in their early 50s, blessed with the gifts of time and remunerative options. Two decades after leaving, Clinton is still younger than the current occupant. “Age and modern medicine is what changes the story entirely. Presidents didn’t used to live this long after their terms,” says Jeffrey Engel, director of Southern Methodist University’s Center for Presidential History.
They have adapted to the times, and mastered Hollywood and social media to share the stories of others, “story” being a favored term of both couples. Higher Ground has a dozen employees. Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton founded HiddenLight Productions to “share the stories of leaders — celebrated and unsung alike,” the 2016 presidential candidate said in an earlier news release. By creating television series, movies, podcasts, digital content and page-turners, the Obamas and Clintons are reaching larger, younger and more diverse audiences than those for White House memoirs.
Barack Obama, author of the best-selling, highly-praised memoir “A Promised Land,” has long celebrated his voracious consumption of popular culture with his annual list of favorite books, music and movies. His “Renegades: Born in the USA” podcast with Springsteen sounds like two boomers chatting about their passions over beers. In their third episode, the 44th president sings more than Bruce does. (Also, Obama, a “renegade,” seriously?)


Even a memoir becomes something else entirely, a global franchise and an event. Michelle Obama’s “Becoming,” has sold more than 15 million copies, bolstered by a documentary, plus an arena tour featuring special guests and merch. With the paperback and young reader versions debuting this week, its appeal showing little chance of waning. Hillary and Chelsea Clinton transformed their 2019 book “The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience,” into an upcoming Apple TV Plus docuseries, created by their production company, which they will host.

This month, the Obamas will launch Netflix’s “Waffles + Mochi,” sort of an international foodie “Sesame Street” with a passel of celebrity guests. Among Higher Ground’s other projects are a television series about Frederick Douglass, a biopic of civil rights leader Bayard Rustin directed by George C. Wolfe and a movie based on Mohsin Hamid’s novel “Exit West” starring Riz Ahmed.
The company is “set up as a platform to tell the types of stories that embody the Obamas’ values and interests,” says Joe Paulsen, Higher Ground’s head of strategy and business. “We have a home with Netflix and Spotify. If we believe in a writer, believe in an idea, we can advocate for it.” Malia Obama, who shares her parent’s interest in entertainment, is  joining the writing staff of Donald Glover’s Amazon project “Hive.” (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)


Contrary to John Quincy Adams’s belief, “the greatest job in the world is being ex-president,” Engel says. “For the most part, they don’t have to do anything they don’t want to. People pay you for your participation. Everywhere you go, people stand up and applaud.”

There was a time when former presidents worried about even the appearance of profiting  from their public service. LBJ Foundation CEO Mark Updegrove, author of “Second Acts: Presidential Lives and Legacies After the White House,” says that even after leaving office, Truman was so wary of “cheapening the office” that, at book signings, he refused to sign with a recognizable brand pen, like, a Cross or a Bic, “for fear it might look like a corporate endorsement,” and he incurred the mailing costs to send copies to readers. In 1958, the Former Presidents Act helped alleviate many financial burdens, providing former chief executives with an array of benefits, including postage.
Subsequent presidents, many after decades in public office, learned they could be remunerated handsomely for a few hours of their time. Interviewer David Frost paid Richard Nixon $600,000 and a share of the profits to tell his story. Gerald Ford was compensated to sit on corporate boards. In 1989, Ronald Reagan set the gold standard when he was given $2 million for two 20-minute speeches and a few public appearances in Japan, opening the floodgates to criticism. It’s a practice that the Clintons and Obamas have continued.
Not every former president prefers to remain in the public light or court Hollywood. George W. Bush works with Clinton on disaster relief and the Presidential Leadership Scholars, but has opted for a quieter life, preferring to paint.

Before leaving the White House, the Clintons and Obamas had never generated the sort of wealth they have now, though Barack Obama received a major payday from the success of his earlier books “Dreams From My Father” and “The Audacity of Hope” that far outstripped his U.S. Senate salary. The Obamas reportedly earned as much as $65 million for their recent memoirs, negotiated by Washington lawyer Robert Barnett, who has represented the Clintons and George W. and Laura Bush.
Bill Clinton, the first (and, so far, only) presidential candidate to play the sax on television, “has always been a voracious reader and a lifelong fan of pop culture — from music and sports to television and film,” says his spokesman Angel Urena. “Bringing these projects to life has given him the chance to try new things, explore different forms of storytelling and work with people he admires across his wide range of interests. It’s been fun, exciting and gratifying.”
Hence, a thriller, which might be more fun than writing a 957-page memoir. The former president is re-partnering with publishing juggernaut James Patterson after their 2018 success with “The President Is Missing,” which sold more than 2 million copies. Their new book out in June is titled “The President’s Daughter.” It is not a sequel, although she also goes missing. “State of Terror,” his wife’s project with acclaimed mystery writer Penny that’s scheduled for October, is about a secretary of state dealing with, according to the news release, “the complex world of high-stakes diplomacy and treachery.”

The life of ex-Oval Office occupants could be easily upended again. Before politics, the most recent former president was a reality television host who branded his name on everything from casinos to steaks. As to what Trump may do next, Updegrove says, “all bets are off. We ain’t seen nothing yet.”
