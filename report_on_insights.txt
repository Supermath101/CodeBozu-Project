INSIGHTS
My team and I have decided to find all the presidents and vice presidents from the east coast and west coast. 
We then found out which coast had more presidents and vice presidents. 
STEPS
We have made a list of all the states in the east coast and west coast. 
We read from our csv file(no duplicate presidents and vice presidents) and got only the birth places of presidents.
We used nested for loops to get the information.
Conclusion
We have found out there are a lot more east coast presidents and vice presidents compared to west coast presidents and vice presidents. 
We have found that there are 41 east coast presidents and vice presidents whereas there are only 4 west coast presidents and vice presidents.
Possible Reasoning
It could be because of the number of states as there are a lot more east coast states than west coast states.
One main reason could be that the west of america took a lot of time to come into the union.
The west coast is a radical wing state but USA is not a radical wing country. This could be a reason why a person from these states can win the swing states which are Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
