"Obama Honors The Late Sen. Harry Reid As A Man 'Who Got Things Done'", "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Former President Barack Obama commemorated late Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Saturday as a man “who got things done,” as Democratic leaders gathered to recall Reid — often laughingly — as a man whose impatience for pleasantries was part of a drive to improve the lives of ordinary Americans.//LAS VEGAS (AP) — Former President Barack Obama commemorated late Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Saturday as a man “who got things done,” as Democratic leaders gathered to recall Reid — often laughingly — as a man whose impatience for pleasantries was part of a drive to improve the lives of ordinary Americans.//The turnout at Reid’s Las Vegas memorial service testified to his impact on some of the most important legislation of the 21st century, despite coming from a childhood of poverty and deprivation in Nevada. President Joe Biden escorted Reid’s widow, Landra Reid, to her seat at the outset of services, before an honor guard bore the flag-draped casket to the well of a hushed auditorium.//Reid died Dec. 28 at home in Henderson, Nevada, at 82 of complications from pancreatic cancer.//“Let there be no doubt. Harry Reid will be considered one of the greatest Senate majority leaders in history,” Biden said. Speakers credited Reid’s work on strengthening health care and on Wall Street reform and economic recovery in the wake of the 2008 recession, as part of what is considered one of the most consequential congressional sessions of modern times.//Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who described Reid to mourners as a “truly honest and original character,” spoke during an invitation-only memorial.//Obama, who credits Reid for his rise to the White House, delivered the eulogy.//When Reid helped pass the Affordable Care Act at the start of Obama’s first term, “he didn’t do it to burnish his own legacy,” Obama said. When Reid was a boy, Obama explained, Reid’s family was so poor that “he didn’t even know” what health care was. When a tooth went bad, his father pulled it himself. A brother let a broken leg heal on its own.//In Reid’s work in Washington, “he did it for the people back home and families like his, who needed somebody looking out for them, when nobody else did. Harry got things done,” Obama said.//“The thing about Harry, He never gave up. He never gave up. He never gave up on anybody who cared about him,” said Biden, who served for two decades with Reid in the Senate and worked with him for eight years when Biden was vice president.//“If Harry said he was going to do something, he did it,” Biden added. “You could bank on it.”//A running and humorous theme throughout the funeral was ‘Harry Reiding’ — Reid’s habit of abruptly ending telephone conversations without saying goodbye.//“I have to tell you, every time I hear a dial tone, I think of Harry,” Biden told mourners.//Reid’s son Leif sought to explain his father’s well-known habit, a move that sometimes left the other person — whether powerful politicians or close family — chatting away for several minutes before realizing he was no longer there.//“I probably got hung up on the most by Harry Reid, two or three times a day, for 12 years,” Pelosi said.//“Sometimes I even called him back and said Harry, ’I was singing your praises,” Pelosi said. To which Reid replied: “I don’t want to hear it,” she said, before she’d hear the phone click dead again.//Leif Reid said that was “part of the narrative” of his father’s life, and a gesture about Reid preserving time for family.//“When he hung up on you, maybe so quickly, it isn’t as much about him being brusque as it is about him being devoted to my mom,” Leif Reid said. All four of his siblings also spoke at the memorial service.//Reid served for 34 years in Washington and led the Senate through a crippling recession and the Republican takeover of the House after the 2010 elections.//Harry Mason Reid hitchhiked 40 miles (64 kilometers) to high school and was an amateur boxer before he was elected to the Nevada state Assembly at 28. He had graduated from Utah State University and worked nights as a U.S. Capitol police officer while attending George Washington University Law School in Washington.//In 1970, at age 30, he was elected state lieutenant governor with Democratic Gov. Mike O’Callaghan. Reid was elected to the House in 1982 and the Senate in 1986.//He built a political machine in Nevada that for years helped Democrats win key elections. When he retired in 2016 after an exercise accident at home left him blind in one eye, he picked former Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto to replace him.//Cortez Masto became the first woman from Nevada and the first Latina ever elected to the U.S. Senate.//Reid’s body will be flown to Washington to lie in state at the Capitol rotunda, and another ceremony will be held there on Wednesday.//The host of Saturday’s Las Vegas services, Marcus Faust, said Reid’s casket will return to Nevada for burial at the family plot in Searchlight.//

Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of former President Donald Trump’s closest allies in Congress, on Sunday rejected a request for an interview by the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection.//In a combative letter to committee chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Jordan said, “The American people are tired of Democrats’ nonstop investigations and partisan witch hunts.”//He said the interview request “amounts to an unprecedented and inappropriate demand to examine the basis for a colleague’s decision on a particular matter pending before the House of Representatives.”//“This request is far outside the bounds of any legitimate inquiry, violates core constitutional principles and would serve to further erode legislative norms,” he added.//Thompson told Jordan in a letter last month that the panel wants him to provide information surrounding his communications with Trump on Jan. 6 and Trump’s efforts to challenge the result of the 2020 election.//“We understand that you had at least one and possibly multiple communications with President Trump on January 6th,” the letter read. “We would like to discuss each such communication with you in detail.”//In his response Sunday, Jordan insisted, “I have no relevant information that would assist the Select Committee in advancing any legitimate legislative purpose.”//He accused Democrats of using the committee as “a partisan cudgel against their political adversaries.”//Jordan is a staunch supporter of Trump’s false claims about voter fraud. The lawmaker brought those claims up during an October hearing on a motion to hold former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in contempt for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena.//In that hearing, Jordan admitted that he spoke with Trump on the day of the attack.//“Of course, I talked to the president,” Jordan told members of the Rules Committee, in response to questioning from the panel’s chairman, Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass. “I talked to him that day. I’ve been clear about that. I don’t recall the number of times, but it’s not about me. I know you want to make it about that.”//The panel is also seeking information regarding Jordan’s meeting with Trump and members of his administration in November and December 2020, and in early January 2021, “about strategies for overturning the results of the 2020 election.” Thompson’s letter said the committee is also interested in any discussions Jordan may have had during that time regarding the possibility of presidential pardons for people involved in any aspect of the Capitol attack or the planning for the two rallies that took place that day.//

"Donald Trump Reportedly Dialed Sean Hannity Into Oval Office Meetings", "Trends Reporter, HuffPost//Trends Reporter, HuffPost//Former President Donald Trump and his Fox News influencers were so joined at the hip that he even dialed Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs into Oval Office meetings, according to an unidentified former senior administration official, The Washington Post reported Sunday.//A “lot of it” concerned public relations — “what he should be saying and how he should be saying it; he should be going harder against wearing masks or whatever,” Trump’s former press secretary Stephanie Grisham told the Post, apparently confirming the information.//According to Grisham, Trump frequently consulted with Hannity and Fox News host Jeanine Pirro.//“There were times the president would come down [in the] morning and say, ‘Well, Sean thinks we should do this,’ or, ‘Judge Jeanine thinks we should do this,’” said Grisham. She described Hannity on CNN last Thursday as Trump’s “shadow adviser,” who counseled him on “many, many things.”//Jeff Cohen, author of “Cable News Confidential,” slammed the relationship as a violation of public trust by Fox hosts because viewers have no idea how close they are to Trump and are under the impression there is some objectivity to their on-air reports. //The startlingly close relationship between a sitting president and what the Post called a “Cable Cabinet” of members of a right-wing news operation was underscored by the multiple texts released last month by the House select committee investigating the Jan, 6 insurrection.//As last year’s Jan. 6 violence unfolded in the U.S. Capitol, Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham, Brian Kilmeade and Hannity all texted then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, pleading with him to press Trump to intervene to stop the siege. They all later downplayed the insurrection on Fox News, or even blamed the attack on the building on Antifa or members of the Black Lives Matter.//It was one of the few times Trump wasn’t listening to his Fox News brain trust. It took him more than three hours on Jan. 6 to speak out against the violence.//“He can’t mention the election again. Ever,” Hannity texted Meadows days after the insurrection. “I did not have a good call with him today.”//But Trump enthusiastically embraced just about every other “fantastical” Fox favorite, including support for now-disgraced attorney Sidney Powell, who repeatedly pitched wildly baseless claims of election fraud, informal Trump adviser Michael Pillsbury told the Post.//Trump’s Fox pals could suddenly “completely change his mind on something,” said his former communications director Alyssa Farah Griffin, and the staff would have to scramble to do damage control.//Hannity wielded clout even during Trump’s 2016 campaign, calling Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel to complain about strategy, according to the Post.//The first time then-Speaker of the House Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) met the president-elect at Trump Tower in December 2016, Hannity called mid-meeting, reported Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa in their book “Peril.” //Trump “answered the call as Ryan and his advisers sat silent. ‘Yeah, I’m here with Paul,’ Trump told Hannity. ’Oh? You want to talk with him?’”//Trump put the call on speakerphone and said: “Sean, talk to Paul,” which he did for about seven minutes, according to “Peril.” //Check out the full Washington Post story here.//Trends Reporter, HuffPost//

Though there has been progress since the historic 2015 Paris climate agreement “we are nowhere near where we need to be.”//His comments came as conference leaders acknowledged Monday that many key sticking points exist after a week of talks.//A trust gap between rich and poor nations on climate change issues emerged when the negotiations went through a check of what’s been accomplished and what’s left to be done. Developing countries used versions of the word “disappointing” five times when leaders talked Monday about the progress to date.//The U.N. climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, is the former American president’s first since he helped deliver the triumph of the 2015 Paris climate accord, when nations committed to cutting fossil fuel and agricultural emissions fast enough to keep the Earth’s warming below catastrophic levels of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).//That celebration has faded and been replaced by worry. Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris accord. President Joe Biden put America back in as soon as he took office this year but U.S. efforts at fighting climate change were set back years by the Trump move.//“1.5 C is on life support now, it’s in ICU,” said Alden Meyer, a long-time observer of climate talks with E3G, an environmental think tank.//Obama’s appearance on the sidelines of the talks sought to remind governments of the elation that surrounded the Paris accord, and urge them to announce more immediate, concrete steps to put the 2015 deal into action.//“The U.S. is back and in moving more boldly. The U.S. is not alone,” Obama said.//Obama noted efforts by the United States — the world’s second-worst climate polluter now after China — stalled when Trump pulled out of the climate accord.//“I wasn’t real happy about that,” he admitted, but added that optimism is required to save the planet.//“There are times where I feel discouraged. There are times where the future seems somewhat bleak. There are times where I am doubtful that humanity can get its act together before it’s too late,” Obama said. “We can’t afford hopelessness.”//Despite opposition within Biden’s own Democratic party that has blocked the climate-fighting legislation, Obama said he was confident that some version of Biden’s ambitious climate bill will pass in Congress in the next few weeks.//“It will set the United States on course to meet its new climate targets,” he said.//And while in 2015, rapport between Obama administration negotiators and their Chinese counterparts was seen as paving the way to the global Paris accord, Obama on Monday criticized Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin for not joining other global leaders at the climate talks in Glasgow.//“It was particularly discouraging to see the leaders of two of the world’s largest emitters, China and Russia, decline to even attend the proceedings, and their national plans reflect what appears to be a dangerous lack of urgency,” Obama said.//Obama spoke earlier Monday to a session on Pacific Island nations, including ones whose existence is threatened by rising oceans under climate change.//“All of us have a part to play. All of us have work to do. All of us have sacrifices to make” on climate, he said. “But those of us who live in wealthy nations, those of us who helped to precipitate the problem ... we have an added burden.”//When he was briefing the U.N. climate conference (COP26) on the first week’s progress, COP26 President Alok Sharma had to correct himself about the number of issues settled, changing “many” into “some.”//No deals have been made yet on three main goals of the U.N. conference. Those are pledges to cut emissions in half by 2030 to keep the Paris climate deal’s 1.5 degree Celsius temperature limit goal alive; the need for $100 billion annually in financial help from rich countries to poor ones; and the idea that half of that money goes to adapting to global warming’s worst effects. Several other issues, including trading carbon and transparency, also weren’t solved yet.//Numerous developing nations were pessimistic. They called progress “disappointing” and not near enough, saying announcements on fighting climate change were high in quantity but worried that they were low in quantity.//Representatives of 77 developing nations, along with China, said until this climate conference fixes the financial pledge problem to help poor nations cope with climate change these talks cannot be successful.//Ahmadou Sebory Touré of Guinea, speaking on behalf of poor nations, said rich countries not fulfilling their $100 billion pledge shows those countries are just making “an empty commitment.”//“There is a history of broken promises and unfulfilled commitments by developed countries,” Diego Pacheco Balanza of Bolivia told the conference.//Scientists say the urgency of global warming is as great as the dire speeches at Glasgow have conveyed, with the planet only a few years away from the point where meeting the goals set in the Paris accord becomes impossible, due to mounting damage from coal, petroleum, agriculture and other pollution sources.//The last few days have seen huge protests in Glasgow and around Europe for faster action in fighting global warming.//Obama told young people “you are right to be frustrated,” but then relayed the advice his mother gave him when he was young.//“Don’t sulk. Get busy, get to work and change what needs to be changed,” he said. “Vote like your life depends on it — because it does.”//___//Associated Press reporter Aniruddha Ghosal contributed to this report.//

"Obama Sharply Criticizes Youngkin In Virginia's Governor's Race", "RICHMOND, Va (AP) — Former President Barack Obama offered a sharp rebuke of the Republican candidate for Virginia governor, Glenn Youngkin, as he encouraged voters on Saturday to support Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the closely watched race.//RICHMOND, Va (AP) — Former President Barack Obama offered a sharp rebuke of the Republican candidate for Virginia governor, Glenn Youngkin, as he encouraged voters on Saturday to support Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the closely watched race.//Obama accused Youngkin of portraying himself as a friendly everyman while encouraging what Obama called “lies and conspiracy theories” about widespread voting fraud in the 2020 elections. Former President Donald Trump has continued to push the false narrative about election fraud, which fueled the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.//“Either he actually believes in the same conspiracy theories that resulted in a mob, or he doesn’t believe it but he is willing to go along with it, to say or do anything to get elected. And maybe that’s worse ... because that says something about character,” Obama said.//Youngkin, a former private equity executive and a first-time candidate, initially made “election integrity” the centerpiece of his campaign and refused  for months to say whether President Joe Biden was legitimately elected. He has since said that Biden was, and that there was not widespread fraud in last year’s elections.//Obama described McAuliffe — the state’s governor from 2014-2018 — as an experienced, steady hand and told a crowd of what organizers said was 2,000 people gathered outdoors at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond that the Nov. 2 election would “show the country and the world that we’re not going to indulge in our worst instincts.”//The former president said he understood voters are worn down, both from the country’s divisive politics and the strain of the pandemic. But he said there’s too much at stake to not cast a ballot.//“We don’t have time to be tired. What is required is sustained effort,” he said.//Asked for comment, a Youngkin campaign spokesman called Obama’s remarks “false statements” and accused The Associated Press of “indulging the fantasies of the Terry and the left because they can’t run on their failed record and radical vision for the future.”//The Youngkin campaign has said election security is a bipartisan concern and has tried to draw a comparison between the false claims of fraud today and the 2000 presidential election, when a Supreme Court ruling decided the winner and McAuliffe blasted the decision and said the election had been stolen.//McAuliffe is seeking a return to office in the only state where the incumbent cannot serve consecutive terms. Less than two weeks out from the Nov. 2 election, polls show a tight race in a state Biden carried by 10 percentage points last fall.//While New Jersey is also holding an election for governor on Nov. 2, it’s the Virginia race that’s grabbed national attention as a possible indication of voter sentiment before next year’s midterms.//Numerous Democratic elected officials including U.S. Reps. Donald McEachin and Bobby Scott, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine and Gov. Ralph Northam also delivered remarks at Saturday’s event.//The officials cast the election as a choice between a proven leader and an extremist who would roll back progressive reforms implemented during the past two years of full Democratic control of state government, including an expansion of voting rights and abortion access, tighter gun laws and criminal justice reforms. Multiple speakers acknowledged the contest is close.//“We cannot take any chances,” Northam said.//Several speakers sought to tie Youngkin and his running mates to Trump.//“Glenn Youngkin is extreme. This guy is a fanboy for Donald Trump,” said Jaime Harrison, chairman of the Democratic National Committee.//Obama also visited Virginia’s capital to rally Democrats during Northam’s 2017 race for governor against Republican Ed Gillespie, who lost by about 9 percentage points.//His visit marked the latest in a series of appearances by high-profile Democrats who have come to the state in recent days to press the case for McAuliffe’s candidacy. They include voting rights activist Stacey Abrams, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Vice President Kamala Harris, who told a crowd Thursday night, “This race is tight.”//Biden, who campaigned with McAuliffe over the summer, is joining the Democratic nominee in northern Virginia on Tuesday.//National Republican groups criticized McAuliffe on Saturday for the procession of high-profile surrogates.//“As Biden’s poll numbers continue to tank, McAuliffe is going down with him and no amount of heavy hitter politicians will right the ship,” said Maddie Anderson, a spokeswoman for the Republican Governors Association.//Youngkin, who has generally steered clear of outside supporters in the final stretch, held a Saturday evening rally in suburban Richmond at the start of a statewide bus tour.//Speaking to a crowd of what the campaign said was 2,000 people in a field next to a grocery market, he delivered a half-hour outline of his platform, promising to cut taxes, roll back red tape, ban critical race theory and roll out an expansive charter school program.//He said the election offered a chance to change the trajectory of the state to one where the “relentless pursuit of a better life, of prosperity is not burdened or blocked by self-dealing politicians.”//“This thing is a toss-up,” he said, and later predicted that he would win.//Youngkin did not directly address Obama’s harshest criticisms. But the former collegiate basketball player did crack a joke in reference to one element of Obama’s remarks, saying that he had challenged  the former president, an avid basketball fan, to a game of one-on-one.//Trump has not campaigned alongside Youngkin, and Youngkin’s campaign has not responded  to questions from The Associated Press about whether he has been asked to. Trump has endorsed Youngkin multiple times and called into a rally organized by a right-wing radio host this month to exhort the crowd to vote for him.//

"Barack Obama Appears In Ad Opposing California Recall, Supporting Gavin Newsom", "Reporter, HuffPost//Reporter, HuffPost//Former President Barack Obama is the latest high-profile figure to appear in an ad supporting Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and urging Californians to vote “no” in next Tuesday’s California recall election.//The spot released Wednesday is a big get for Newsom. The former president has largely stayed out of the political fray since leaving office but remains a popular figure among Democratic voters. //“Governor Newsom has spent the past year and a half protecting California communities,” Obama says in the ad. “Now Republicans are trying to recall him from office and overturn common-sense COVID safety measures for health care workers and school staff.”//The ad, which Newsom shared on Twitter, is slated to start running on television Thursday, Politico reported. //“Your vote could be the difference between protecting our kids and putting them at risk; helping Californians recover or taking us backwards,” Obama says in the ad. “Protect California by voting no on the Republican recall.”//Listen to @BarackObama -- California has a big choice to make on September 14th.Your vote could be the difference.Vote NO on the Republican Recall.There’s too much on the line to sit this one out. pic.twitter.com/U3cKDcRaVY//Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have also appeared in ads opposing the Republican-led recall effort in California.//Warren and Vice President Kamala Harris have been rallying alongside Newsom in person over the past week. Harris, who appeared with him in the San Francisco Bay Area on Wednesday, emphasized the importance of Democratic enthusiasm for blocking the recall.//While Democrats have a massive edge in California, voter turnout among the state’s Republicans is expected to be high.//President Joe Biden said he would also stump for Newsom in California early next week. //Among the 40-plus candidates seeking to unseat Newsom, the highest-polling candidate is conservative radio host Larry Elder ― a supporter of President Donald Trump who denies human-caused climate change, believes abortion is “murder,” wants to disband all of California’s COVID-19 safety measures and is under police investigation for domestic violence allegations by his ex-fiancee. //A Republican governor in California could spell serious trouble for Democrats’ narrow majority in Congress.

"Barack Obama's Scaled-Down Birthday Bash Still Has A Lot Of Celebs", "Reporter, HuffPost//Reporter, HuffPost//You may not be very surprised to find out Barack Obama appears to have a lot of close family and friends. //The former president’s 60th birthday party was set to proceed Saturday as a “significantly scaled back” version of the original plan given the ominous threat of the delta variant of the coronavirus, an Obama spokesperson said this week. But according to photos snapped on and above Martha’s Vineyard ― the posh New England island where the nation’s wealthiest go to be amongst their own ― “scaled back” is still looking pretty impressive. //The newly minted sexagenarian will be feted inside a mammoth white tent nuzzled against his family’s $12 million vacation home, which sits on 30 acres of oceanfront property. Aerial shots taken Friday revealed grounds that were abuzz with caterers and party-planning staff ― although presumably fewer than the 200-plus originally expected to work the event. Sofas dotted the outdoor area in intimate clusters, while dozens of sand-colored chairs waited to be unstacked and ringed around tables.//Obama himself was photographed on an island golf course Saturday morning.//On Wednesday ― his actual birthday ― former first lady Michelle Obama posted images of her husband to Instagram, writing, “Still turning my head after all these years.” //The 44th president attracted some criticism when details of his massive party leaked this week amid the nationwide surge in COVID-19 cases. The U.S. is once again recording around 100,000 new cases on a daily basis, marking a return to levels not seen since the fall and winter. //Obama was not exactly throwing caution to the wind: He had hired a COVID-19 coordinator to verify that all attendees tested negative before the event, and had asked everybody to be fully vaccinated. The party is also largely outdoors.//Still, spokesperson Hannah Hankins said Wednesday that the event would be downsized to “include only family and close friends.”//A post shared by Michelle Obama (@michelleobama)//It remains unclear what size the guest list has been whittled down to. The original plan was to welcome some 475 guests, according to Axios, but the Obama camp never confirmed that amount. At least eight aides, including Michelle Obama’s chief of staff, were tasked with making the unpleasant calls to uninvite people from the party, according to The New York Times. //The result was, apparently, some hurt feelings among former Obama administration staffers, who still noticed the likes of Chrissy Teigen and John Legend arriving on the island ahead of the main event. A “majority” of the former staffers had been uninvited, the Times said, noting that many “generally credit themselves with helping create the Obama legacy that has allowed the former president to settle in so comfortably with the A-list crowd.”//Paparazzi shots published by The Daily Mail also documented the arrivals of Dwayne Wade and Gabrielle Union, Steven Colbert and Don Cheadle. Beyoncé and Jay-Z were reportedly marked as attending, the Times reported Friday; tabloids said that they were already on the island.//Legend is expected to perform Saturday night, according to The New York Post. (Not Pearl Jam, as had been rumored.) //John Kerry ― Obama’s former secretary of state and the current administration’s special presidential envoy for climate ― was photographed arriving on Martha’s Vineyard by private jet. //Larry David, David Letterman and Conan O’Brien were reportedly among those who were disinvited; Oprah Winfrey and Ava DuVernay bowed out on their own, according to the Times. //The White House previously said in a statement that President Joe Biden will not be in attendance, although he “looks forward to catching up with former President Obama soon and properly welcoming him into the over 60 club.” //White House press secretary Jen Psaki ― an Obama administration alumni herself ― appeared to defend the former president’s birthday bash on Friday when asked whether Obama was setting a good example for the American people. Psaki said COVID-19 transmission in Martha’s Vineyard was considered “moderate,” meaning the area was not subject to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s updated masking guidance, which targets counties with high or substantially high transmission. (The CDC now categorizes the island as having “high” transmission, a change that appears to have come Friday, according to local reports.)//With luck, the only thing guests will pick up this weekend will be the custom baseball caps Obama reportedly had made for the occasion that read, “44 at 60.”//Reporter, HuffPost//

"Thoughtful Quotes About Fatherhood From Barack Obama", "Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life//Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life//Barack Obama has been known to wax poetic about international relations, domestic policy and political philosophy. He takes the same approach to the topic of parenting. //The former president has two daughters, Malia and Sasha, with his wife, Michelle Obama. Over his decades in the spotlight, Obama has opened up about his experience raising children, from the ways they inspire him to his embarrassing dad moments.//In honor of his birthday, we’ve rounded up 20 quotes about fatherhood from Obama.//“For many of us, our fathers show us by the example they set the kind of people they want us to become. Whether biological, foster, or adoptive, they teach us through the encouragement they give, the questions they answer, the limits they set, and the strength they show in the face of difficulty and hardship.”//“What I’ve realized is that life doesn’t count for much unless you’re willing to do your small part to leave our children — all of our children — a better world. Any fool can have a child. That doesn’t make you a father. It’s the courage to raise a child that makes you a father.”//“To Malia and Sasha and their friends, discrimination in any form against anyone doesn’t make sense. As president, and as a dad, that makes me proud.”//“Watching 9-, 10-year-old girls playing basketball and just fierce, just intense about it, is terrific. And last year I actually did some coaching ... And you know what’s amazing is how much more stressful coaching and watching these girls was than when I was playing. You just want them to win so bad. And when they actually run a play and it works — you’re just ecstatic. And a couple of heartbreaking losses and you’re just feeling terrible. But they’re wonderful.” //“Above all, children need our unconditional love — whether they succeed or make mistakes; when life is easy and when life is tough.”//“I’m inspired by the love people have for their children. And I’m inspired by my own children, how full they make my heart. They make me want to work to make the world a little bit better. And they make me want to be a better man.”//“They’ve handled it so well. They are wonderful girls. They are smart and funny. But most importantly, they’re kind. They don’t have an attitude.”//“It’s a wonderful thing if you are married and living in a home with your children, but don’t just sit in the house and watch ‘SportsCenter’ all weekend long. That’s why so many children are growing up in front of the television. As fathers and parents, we’ve got to spend more time with them, and help them with their homework, and replace the video game or the remote control with a book once in awhile.”//“Thanksgiving is a family holiday as much as a national one. So for the past seven years I’ve established another tradition: embarrassing my daughters with a corny-copia of dad jokes about turkeys.”//“My daughter leaving me is just breaking my heart. If there are any parents here, I hope you can give me some pointers on how not to cry too much at the ceremony and embarrass her.”//“In the end, that’s what being a parent is all about — those precious moments with our children that fill us with pride and excitement for their future, the chances we have to set an example or offer a piece of advice, the opportunities to just be there and show them that we love them.”//“What I didn’t anticipate was the fact that I get to spend much more time with my kids once I’m president. Because now, I’m living above the store. I have a 30-second commute and so I just set up a rule: I’m having dinner with my crew at 6:30 every night unless I’m traveling ... And I’m going to be sitting there and I’m going to be entirely absorbed with stories about the annoying boys and the weird teacher and the drama in the cafeteria, reading Harry Potter and tucking them in and listening to whatever music they’re now listening to.”//“Every father bears a fundamental obligation to do right by their children.”//“We had this nice stretch of about three years where she was doing her thing in her career and I was doing mine. Then we started trying to have kids. Took a while. Michelle had a couple miscarriages and we had to kind of work at it. When Malia was finally born, we were more than ready to be parents, right? ’Cause there had been this six-year stretch in which probably for about half of it, we had been trying, so there was no surprise to it.”//“Michelle figured out much earlier than I did that kids are like plants. They need sun, soil, water, but some of ’em are oaks, and some of ’em are pines, and some of ’em are willows, and some are bamboo. Those seeds of who they are and the pace and ways in which they’re gonna unfold are just uniquely theirs. I think I had a notion with Malia and Sasha, there was sort of a way of doing things — and what Michelle figured out earlier than I did, but I also ended up learning, was each one is just magical in their own ways. A branch is gonna sprout when it’s gonna sprout. A flower’s gonna pop when it’s gonna pop. You just roll with that unfolding, that unfurling of who they are, being comfortable just discovering them as opposed to feeling as if it’s a project.”//“As fathers, we need to be involved in our children’s lives not just when it’s convenient or easy, and not just when they’re doing well — but when it’s difficult and thankless, and they’re struggling. That is when they need us most.”//“The love of being a father was not something I had to work on. It was physical, it was emotional, spiritual, you know. The attachment to my children I felt entirely and completely. I thought to myself: ‘OK. If the baseline is unconditional love, I’ve got that.’”//“[P]ass along the value of empathy to our children. Not sympathy, but empathy ― the ability to stand in somebody else’s shoes; to look at the world through their eyes. Sometimes it’s so easy to get caught up in ‘us,’ that we forget about our obligations to one another. There’s a culture in our society that says remembering these obligations is somehow soft ― that we can’t show weakness, and so therefore we can’t show kindness. But our young boys and girls see that. They see when you are ignoring or mistreating your wife. They see when you are inconsiderate at home; or when you are distant; or when you are thinking only of yourself. And so it’s no surprise when we see that behavior in our schools or on our streets. That’s why we pass on the values of empathy and kindness to our children by living them. We need to show our kids that you’re not strong by putting other people down – you’re strong by lifting them up. That’s our responsibility as fathers.”//“Michelle and I know that our first job, our first responsibility, is instilling a sense of learning, a sense of a love of learning in our kids. And so there are no shortcuts there; we have to do that job. And we can’t just blame teachers and schools if we’re not instilling that commitment, that dedication to learning, in our kids.”//“Malia and Sasha ... Of all that I’ve done in my life, I’m most proud to be your dad.”//Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life", 15.7%

"Ex-Airman Says Guilt Over Drone Strikes Prompted Him To Leak Secrets", "ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A former Air Force intelligence analyst said his guilt over participating in lethal drone strikes in Afghanistan led him to leak government secrets about the drone program to a reporter.//ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A former Air Force intelligence analyst said his guilt over participating in lethal drone strikes in Afghanistan led him to leak government secrets about the drone program to a reporter.//Daniel Hale of Nashville, Tennessee, is scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria after pleading guilty to violating the Espionage Act by leaking top secret documents.//In court papers filed Thursday, Hale’s lawyers asked that he receive a 12- to 18-month sentence, which would be well below sentencing guidelines.//In an 11-page handwritten letter from the Alexandria jail where he’s being held, Hale outlines what led him break the law, describing his regret and horror as he saw gruesome videos of Afghans killed in part because his work helped track them down.//He said when he deployed to Afghanistan in 2012, his job was to track down cellphone signals linked to people believed to be enemy combatants.//“Not a day goes by that I don’t question the justification for my actions,” Hale wrote.//His guilt is compounded by the clinical nature of the drone strike program, in which Afghan targets are killed going about their daily lives — at times with innocent civilians killed as collateral damage — rather than on a traditional battlefield.//“The victorious rifleman, unquestionably remorseful, at least keeps his honor intact by having faced off against his enemy in the battlefield,” Hale wrote. “But what possibly could I have done to cope with the undeniable cruelties that I perpetrated?”//As a result, he said, his conscience compelled him to disclose details about the program to an investigative reporter he had previously met. The documents showed, among other things, that the drone program was not as precise as the government claimed in terms of avoiding civilian deaths.//Hale leaked the documents after he left the Air Force and had taken a civilian job with a contractor assigned to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, where he worked for a brief stint in 2014 as a toponymist, using his Chinese language expertise to help label maps.//Hale’s lawyers argue in court papers that his altruistic motives, and the fact that the government hasn’t shown any actual harm occurred from the leaks, should be taken into account for a light sentence.//“He committed the offense to bring attention to what he believed to be immoral government conduct committed under the cloak of secrecy and contrary to public statements of then-President Obama regarding the alleged precision of the United States military’s drone program,” defense attorneys Todd Richman and Cadence Mertz wrote.//Prosecutors, though, say the classified documents’ disclosure had the potential to cause serious damage. In sentencing papers, prosecutors Gordon Kromberg and Alexander Berrang write that documents leaked by Hale were found in an internet compilation of material designed to help Islamic State fighters avoid detection.//“(A)s a result of Hale’s actions, the most vicious terrorists in the world obtained documents classified by the United States as “Secret” and “Top Secret” — and thought that such documents were valuable enough to disseminate to their own followers in their own manuals,” Kromberg and Berrang wrote.//The prosecutors say that Hale’s leaks were more serious than those made by Reality Winner, a former National Security Agency contractor who received a five-year sentence, the longest given to a whistleblower prosecuted for leaking classified documents to a journalist under the Espionage Act.//Prosecutors don’t request a specific prison term but say an appropriate sentence would be “significantly longer” than the 63 months imposed on Winner.//
