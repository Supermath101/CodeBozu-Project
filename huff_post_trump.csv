"Fox News Host Has Some Blunt Talk For Trump: 'You Have To Learn To Lose'", "Overnight Editor, HuffPost//Overnight Editor, HuffPost//Former President Donald Trump received a dose of truth from an unexpected place on Sunday: Fox News.//“In life, you have to learn to lose,” the network’s Brian Kilmeade told “Media Buzz” host Howie Kurtz when asked about Trump’s complaints of the 2020 election.//“Hillary Clinton has to learn that,” Kilmeade added. “Al Gore pretty much did learn that. Stacey Abrams didn’t learn that.”//Later in the segment, Kurtz noted that Clinton did concede her election loss, something Trump has yet to do. //Kilmeade, one of the hosts of “Fox & Friends,” also bluntly dismissed Trump’s cries of election fraud, telling him to put up or shut up. //“If you did, in fact, get screwed out of this election, put together an A-team list of lawyers ― not the ones we witnessed ― and show us the districts and show us how,” Kilmeade said. “I have not seen any of that.”//See their full conversation below:  //Brian @Kilmeade says Jan. 6 was "the worst day in Republican history," but that even if Trump "did in fact get screwed out of this election,” he needs to show us the proof and it isn't helping him or the country to keep talking about it #Mediabuzz https://t.co/olW3e0wxw8//Overnight Editor, HuffPost//

"Donald Trump Reportedly Dialed Sean Hannity Into Oval Office Meetings", "Trends Reporter, HuffPost//Trends Reporter, HuffPost//Former President Donald Trump and his Fox News influencers were so joined at the hip that he even dialed Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs into Oval Office meetings, according to an unidentified former senior administration official, The Washington Post reported Sunday.//A “lot of it” concerned public relations — “what he should be saying and how he should be saying it; he should be going harder against wearing masks or whatever,” Trump’s former press secretary Stephanie Grisham told the Post, apparently confirming the information.//According to Grisham, Trump frequently consulted with Hannity and Fox News host Jeanine Pirro.//“There were times the president would come down [in the] morning and say, ‘Well, Sean thinks we should do this,’ or, ‘Judge Jeanine thinks we should do this,’” said Grisham. She described Hannity on CNN last Thursday as Trump’s “shadow adviser,” who counseled him on “many, many things.”//Jeff Cohen, author of “Cable News Confidential,” slammed the relationship as a violation of public trust by Fox hosts because viewers have no idea how close they are to Trump and are under the impression there is some objectivity to their on-air reports. //The startlingly close relationship between a sitting president and what the Post called a “Cable Cabinet” of members of a right-wing news operation was underscored by the multiple texts released last month by the House select committee investigating the Jan, 6 insurrection.//As last year’s Jan. 6 violence unfolded in the U.S. Capitol, Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham, Brian Kilmeade and Hannity all texted then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, pleading with him to press Trump to intervene to stop the siege. They all later downplayed the insurrection on Fox News, or even blamed the attack on the building on Antifa or members of the Black Lives Matter.//It was one of the few times Trump wasn’t listening to his Fox News brain trust. It took him more than three hours on Jan. 6 to speak out against the violence.//“He can’t mention the election again. Ever,” Hannity texted Meadows days after the insurrection. “I did not have a good call with him today.”//But Trump enthusiastically embraced just about every other “fantastical” Fox favorite, including support for now-disgraced attorney Sidney Powell, who repeatedly pitched wildly baseless claims of election fraud, informal Trump adviser Michael Pillsbury told the Post.//Trump’s Fox pals could suddenly “completely change his mind on something,” said his former communications director Alyssa Farah Griffin, and the staff would have to scramble to do damage control.//Hannity wielded clout even during Trump’s 2016 campaign, calling Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel to complain about strategy, according to the Post.//The first time then-Speaker of the House Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) met the president-elect at Trump Tower in December 2016, Hannity called mid-meeting, reported Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa in their book “Peril.” //Trump “answered the call as Ryan and his advisers sat silent. ‘Yeah, I’m here with Paul,’ Trump told Hannity. ’Oh? You want to talk with him?’”//Trump put the call on speakerphone and said: “Sean, talk to Paul,” which he did for about seven minutes, according to “Peril.” //Check out the full Washington Post story here.//Trends Reporter, HuffPost//

"Intel Reports Repeatedly Failed To Forecast Capitol Riot", "WASHINGTON (AP) — Intelligence reports compiled by the U.S. Capitol Police in the days before last year’s insurrection envisioned only an improbable or remote risk of violence, even as other assessments warned that crowds of potentially thousands of pro-Trump demonstrators could converge in Washington and create a dangerous situation.//WASHINGTON (AP) — Intelligence reports compiled by the U.S. Capitol Police in the days before last year’s insurrection envisioned only an improbable or remote risk of violence, even as other assessments warned that crowds of potentially thousands of pro-Trump demonstrators could converge in Washington and create a dangerous situation.//The documents, obtained by The Associated Press, underscore the uneven and muddled intelligence that circulated to Capitol Police officers ahead of the Jan. 6 riot, when thousands of Donald Trump loyalists swarmed the Capitol complex and clashed violently with law enforcement officers in their effort to disrupt the certification of the results of the 2020 presidential election. The intelligence reports in particular show how the police agency, up to the day of the riot itself, grievously underestimated the prospect of chaotic violence and disruptions.//The contradictory intelligence produced by law enforcement leading up to the riot has been at the forefront of congressional scrutiny about the Jan. 6 preparations and response, with officials struggling to explain how they failed to anticipate and plan for the deadly riot at the Capitol that day. The shortcomings led to upheaval at the top ranks of the department, including the ouster of the chief,  though the assistant chief in charge of protective and intelligence operations at the time remains in her position.//There was, according to a harshly critical Senate report issued in June, “a lack of consensus about the gravity of the threat posed on January 6, 2021.”//“Months following the attack on the U.S. Capitol, there is still no consensus among USCP officials about the intelligence reports’ threat analysis ahead of January 6, 2021,” the report stated.//The documents, known as a “daily intelligence report” and marked “For Official Use Only,” have been described over the last year in congressional testimony and in the Senate report. The AP on Friday evening obtained full versions of the documents for Jan. 4, 5 and 6 of last year. The New York Times highlighted the Jan. 4 report in a story last year on intelligence shortcomings.//On each of the three days, the documents showed, the Capitol Police ranked as “highly improbable” the probability of acts of civil disobedience and arrests arising from the “Stop the Steal” protest planned for the Capitol. The documents ranked that event and gatherings planned for Jan 6. by about 20 other organizers on a scale of “remote” to “nearly certain” in terms of the likelihood of major disruptions. All were rated as either “remote,” “highly improbable” or “improbable,” the documents show.//“No further information has been found to the exact actions planned by this group,” the Jan. 6 report says about about the “Stop the Steal” rally.//The Million MAGA March planned by Trump supporters is rated in the document as “improbable,” with officials saying it was “possible” that organizers could demonstrate at the Capitol complex, and that though there had been talk of counter-demonstrators, there are “no clear plans by those groups at this time.”//Another event by a group known as Prime Time Patriots was similarly described as having a “highly improbable” chance for disruption, with the report again stating that “no further information has been found to the exact actions planned by this group.”//Those optimistic forecasts are tough to square with separate intelligence assessments compiled by the Capitol Police in late December and early January. Those documents, also obtained by AP, warned that crowds could number in the thousands and include members of extremist groups like the Proud Boys.//A Jan. 3, 2021, memo, for instance, warned of a “significantly dangerous situation for law enforcement and the general public alike” because of the potential attendance of “white supremacists, militia members and others who actively promote violence.”//“Unlike previous post-election protests, the targets of the pro-Trump supporters are not necessarily the counter-protestors as they were previously, but rather Congress itself is the target on the 6th,” the report states.//Adding to the mixed intelligence portrait is a Jan. 5 bulletin prepared by the FBI’s Norfolk field office that warned of the potential for “war” at the Capitol. Capitol Police leaders have said they were unaware of that document at the time. FBI Director Chris Wray has said the report was disseminated through the FBI’s joint terrorism task force, discussed at a command post in Washington and posted on an internet portal available to other law enforcement agencies.//Capitol Police officials have repeatedly insisted that they had no specific or credible intelligence that any demonstration at the Capitol would result in a large-scale attack on the building. Despite scrutiny of intelligence shortcomings, Yogananda Pittman, the assistant chief in charge of intelligence at the time of the riot, remains in that position.//The current police chief, J. Thomas Manger, defended Pittman  in a September interview with the AP, pointing to her decision when she was acting chief to implement recommendations made by the inspector general and to expand the department’s internal intelligence capabilities so officers wouldn’t need to rely so heavily on intelligence gathered by other law enforcement agencies.//

"Rep. Jim Jordan Rebuffs House Panel Interview On Jan. 6 Insurrection", "Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of former President Donald Trump’s closest allies in Congress, on Sunday rejected a request for an interview by the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection.//Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of former President Donald Trump’s closest allies in Congress, on Sunday rejected a request for an interview by the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection.//In a combative letter to committee chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Jordan said, “The American people are tired of Democrats’ nonstop investigations and partisan witch hunts.”//He said the interview request “amounts to an unprecedented and inappropriate demand to examine the basis for a colleague’s decision on a particular matter pending before the House of Representatives.”//“This request is far outside the bounds of any legitimate inquiry, violates core constitutional principles and would serve to further erode legislative norms,” he added.//Thompson told Jordan in a letter last month that the panel wants him to provide information surrounding his communications with Trump on Jan. 6 and Trump’s efforts to challenge the result of the 2020 election.//“We understand that you had at least one and possibly multiple communications with President Trump on January 6th,” the letter read. “We would like to discuss each such communication with you in detail.”//In his response Sunday, Jordan insisted, “I have no relevant information that would assist the Select Committee in advancing any legitimate legislative purpose.”//He accused Democrats of using the committee as “a partisan cudgel against their political adversaries.”//Jordan is a staunch supporter of Trump’s false claims about voter fraud. The lawmaker brought those claims up during an October hearing on a motion to hold former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in contempt for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena.//In that hearing, Jordan admitted that he spoke with Trump on the day of the attack.//“Of course, I talked to the president,” Jordan told members of the Rules Committee, in response to questioning from the panel’s chairman, Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass. “I talked to him that day. I’ve been clear about that. I don’t recall the number of times, but it’s not about me. I know you want to make it about that.”//The panel is also seeking information regarding Jordan’s meeting with Trump and members of his administration in November and December 2020, and in early January 2021, “about strategies for overturning the results of the 2020 election.” Thompson’s letter said the committee is also interested in any discussions Jordan may have had during that time regarding the possibility of presidential pardons for people involved in any aspect of the Capitol attack or the planning for the two rallies that took place that day.//

"Facebook Banned Trump 1 Year Ago. Social Media Hasn't Gotten Much Better.", "National Reporter, HuffPost//National Reporter, HuffPost//It’s been roughly a year since Twitter and Facebook banned Donald Trump (temporarily, in Facebook’s case, even after Trump spent four years making a mockery of the rules written specifically to accommodate him) and pledged to step up their efforts against disinformation, hate speech and radicalization.//So: Have they?//Not really.//Facebook “remains an extremist breeding ground,” offering militia groups unparalleled ability to spread anti-government propaganda, recruit new members and even run ads, according to a report by the Tech Transparency Project released last week. That’s even though the platform claimed to have banned “militarized social movements” back in August 2020.//“One would imagine that an event like the Capitol insurrection would have forced Facebook to clean up its militia mess, but, as per usual, the company puts profits over everything,” Michelle Kuppersmith, executive director of the Campaign for Accountability, said in an emailed statement. “The prevalence of these groups is startlingly similar to what we found a year ago.”//In a separate study focused on election misinformation, MediaMatters found Facebook continues to host ― and amplify ― the same “Stop the Steal” falsehoods that boosted Trump’s monthslong attempt to overthrow his 2020 election defeat. //Troublingly, MediaMatters also found that many of the groups have pivoted and are now also seeking to undermine the legitimacy of state-level elections ahead of this year’s midterms.//“Facebook’s advertising tools can now ‘nanotarget’ an individual user, suggesting that we have entered a new era of personalized propaganda,” warned Fight for the Future, a nonprofit tech advocacy group.//These concerns are compounded by more fundamental problems with how Facebook decides to prioritize the content its users see. As documents leaked by former Facebook employee Frances Haugen show, Facebook’s own algorithms, informed by the unregulated use of users’ data, continue to drive polarization at an unprecedented scale.//This polarized audience generates mountains of cash for Facebook and its new parent company, Meta. Because anger is more profitable than comity.//Other social media companies are also struggling to police bad actors. In December, for instance, a well-intended privacy policy rolled out on Twitter was instead exploited by far-right extremists to get journalists, researchers and even comedians banned from the site.//However poorly Facebook and company have done policing themselves, Trump’s own forthcoming Truth Social is likely to do far worse. The venture (no, not that one, or that one, or that one) is slated to launch in February, with former GOP Rep. Devin Nunes at the helm.//If social media companies can’t, or won’t, curb their own worst impulses, the ultimate, urgent answer is federal regulation.//That includes a federal data privacy law of the sort being pushed by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), as well as more conventional antitrust legislation championed by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).//“Facebook cares more about turning a profit by coddling white nationalists, scammers and anti-democratic right-wing figures than protecting Americans’ private data,” Wyden remarked last week in a tweet promoting his bill. “Congress must pass strong federal privacy legislation in 2022.”//Wyden continued making the case for legislation at a news conference this week.//“If we had a strong privacy law on the books, Mark Zuckerberg would already be in jail for his serial lying about Facebook’s abuse of Americans’ data,” Wyden said. “Congress has the opportunity to act now by passing a comprehensive privacy law that can cut off the flow of data to Facebook’s outrage machine by setting strong new rules for how companies can collect, share and use Americans’ personal information.//“That will go right to Facebook’s business model and hit its bottom line, which seems to be the only thing that company cares about.”//Absent federal action, Fight For the Future says we should expect to see Facebook and the social media industry do more harm in 2022 ― and beyond. //“We cannot restructure society’s relationship with social media or have safe and fair elections without ending the exploitation and manipulation that currently underpins our digital lives,” Fight for the Future said in a statement. “Facebook’s business model has evolved into social engineering via psychological warfare, and it’s crucial that lawmakers address this existential threat. In order to protect the integrity of the future elections, lawmakers must disarm Facebook’s data weapon by regulating surveillance, not speech.”//National Reporter, HuffPost//

After “some informal chats,” members “started throwing around ideas of what we could do, how we could formalize it,” she added.//It “will be important for people” who are still supporting Trump to “hear from people who actually worked with him day in, day out, worked with a lot of people in his inner circle,” Grisham said.//Grisham said she hopes to travel the country to speak to Trump supporters in an effort to help them understand “who he is.” He “cares about no one but himself,” she added.//“This man is a master manipulator.

"Trump Gushed They're 'Fighting For Me' As He 'Gleefully' Watched Capitol Riot On TV: Ex-Aide", "Trends Reporter, HuffPost//Trends Reporter, HuffPost//Then-President Donald Trump “gleefully” watched the violence at the U.S. Capitol unfold on TV a year ago from the White House dining room, and he gushed: “Look at all of the people fighting for me,” his former press secretary Stephanie Grisham revealed Thursday on CNN.//Grisham, who has been harshly critical of the former president since quitting the Trump administration after the insurrection, was asked on CNN’s “New Day” about information that aides and even family members pleaded with Trump to intercede to stop the violence.//“I don’t know specifically” about that, said Grisham, though she added: “I know Mrs. Trump did not” urge him to take action to stop the riot.//“All I know about that day was he was in the dining room gleefully watching on his TV, as he often did. ‘Look at all of the people fighting for me.’ Hitting rewind. Watching it again. That’s what I know,” said Grisham.//Trump took no action to stop the violence for more than three hours, investigators have determined. He had incited his supporters earlier in the day and encouraged them to confront Congress as he repeated the lie that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen from him.//Grisham, who was then working as press secretary and chief of staff for Melania Trump, has said she quit her job after she asked the then-first lady on Jan. 6 if she would tweet a message asking rioters to stand down. She flatly responded: “No,” Grisham recounted. Trump’s term ended two weeks later.//Grisham met with the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, events on Wednesday and spoke with lawmakers for about an hour, she told CNN. She said she answered “every question that they asked of me, and I’m going to continue to cooperate.”//Grisham was also asked on “New Day” about texts obtained by the committee that had been sent on Jan. 6, 2021, by Fox News host Sean Hannity to then chief of staff Mark Meadows pleading with Meadows to urge Trump to “ask people to leave the Capitol.”//Grisham said she had no direct knowledge of the texts but described Hannity as a “shadow adviser” to Trump and said she spoke with Hannity often when she worked at the White House.//“He definitely advised the president on many, many things to do. So it didn’t surprise me he was reaching out to Meadows or anybody else because that was something he did often to get a message to the president,” Grisham said.//Trends Reporter, HuffPost//

"Richard Grenell: Worst Thing About Jan. 6 Was When Trump Got Kicked Off Twitter", "Reporter, HuffPost//Reporter, HuffPost//A onetime aide of former President Donald Trump has a hot take about Jan. 6 that defies all logic.//Richard Grenell, who served in the Trump administration as acting director of national intelligence, appeared on Newsmax Thursday to suggest the worst thing that happened on Jan. 6, 2021.//No, it wasn’t the riot on Capitol Hill or the attempt to violently overturn a presidential election.//Rather, Grenell claims the real victim was Trump’s Twitter account, which the former president was banned from using two days after a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.//“January 6th was a terrible day because it’s the day Big Tech and the media kicked President Trump off Twitter and silenced his voice,” Grenell said. “That was the day that was an attack on our democracy.” (Again, for the record, Twitter actually banned Trump’s account on Jan. 8.)//Grenell also claimed that the real enemies of democracy are people who oppose voter ID laws ― which Republican officials have primarily used to try and suppress Democratic voters, and which purport to address a “voter fraud” problem that in reality is vanishingly small.//Ric Grenell: "January 6th was a terrible day because it's the day Big Tech and the media kicked President Trump off Twitter" pic.twitter.com/uRLTkl3qNT//Grenell is only one of many conservatives who have tried to minimize and misrepresent the events of Jan. 6, when a mob of Trump supporters violently forced their way into the Capitol, breaking windows and scaling walls, in an effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, which Joe Biden won. Some of the rioters were chanting “Hang Mike Pence,” referring to Trump’s vice president.//Lawmakers were hurriedly evacuated, and rioters broke into the Senate chamber and some offices. Several people died in connection with the violence, more than 100 people were injured, and federal prosecutors have said the day’s events resulted in $1.5 million worth of damages.//Yet some Republicans have tried to wave away the gravity of the attack, with Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) likening it to “a normal tourist visit,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) calling it “by and large... a peaceful protest” and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) announcing plans to lead a sort of walking tour retracing the steps of what he called “patriotic Americans... who had no intent of breaking the law or doing violence.”//On Thursday, Twitter users had strong opinions on Grenell’s (likely trollish) comments, with some pointing out that he’d gotten the date of the ban wrong.//Not to be too pedantic here, but it was 2 days later when Trump was actually booted from Twitter. https://t.co/CjOlpH4QTB//White supremacy CLOAKS itself in fake victimHOOD//If you care more about a Twitter account than democracy, there is no reaching out to the "other side".//Reporter, HuffPost//

"Sean Duffy Ignores Trump's Plea To Run For Wisconsin Governor", "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Retired Republican U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy announced Thursday that he won’t run for Wisconsin governor this year, ignoring pleas to do so by former President Donald Trump.//MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Retired Republican U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy announced Thursday that he won’t run for Wisconsin governor this year, ignoring pleas to do so by former President Donald Trump.//Duffy also ruled out a run for U.S. Senate, another sign that Republican incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson plans on seeking a third term this year. Johnson has not said yet whether he will run again.//Duffy announced his intention not to run on Jay Weber’s conservative talk radio show. He had not taken any public steps toward mounting a run, but until this week the vocal Trump supporter had not ruled it out either. Duffy doesn’t live in Wisconsin, had not been raising money for a campaign, had not assembled a team and had been silent on Trump’s call for him to enter the race.//“Hopefully I’m not riding off into the sunset,” the 50-year-old Duffy told Weber. “I’m just running into the sunset right now. ... If an opportunity presents itself, I’d like to come back and partake in Wisconsin politics.”//Duffy, the father of nine children, said the time he needs to care for his family did not mesh with the demands of running for a statewide office.//Duffy’s decision not to run leaves former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch as the highest profile Republican in the race against Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.//The only inkling that a Duffy run for governor might be possible came in October when Trump issued a statement saying he was “working hard to get very popular and capable Former Congressman Sean Duffy of Wisconsin to run.”//“He would be fantastic!” Trump said then. “A champion athlete, Sean loves the people of Wisconsin, and would be virtually unbeatable. His wife, Rachel, is likewise an incredible person. ... Run Sean, Run!”//Duffy, a former lumberjack athlete and frequent contributor to Fox News, was featured on MTV’s “The Real World: Boston” in 1997. He met his future wife, Rachel Campos-Duffy, on the set of MTV’s “Road Rules: All Stars” in 1998.//Duffy served as a special prosecutor and Ashland County district attorney. He was elected to Congress as part of the tea party wave in 2010 and served until his resignation in 2019 after learning that his ninth child had a heart condition. He sold his home in Wisconsin in September and is living in New Jersey.//Kleefisch, who served as former GOP Gov. Scott Walker’s lieutenant governor for eight years, has also praised Trump and tried to appeal to conservative Republicans in an attempt to fend off a serious challenge in the Aug. 9 primary. Several lesser-known Republicans are also running. And former U.S. Senate candidate Kevin Nicholson, a retired Marine, has said he would run for either governor or Senate, depending on whether Johnson seeks a third term.//Johnson did not immediately return a message seeking comment.//Evers narrowly defeated Walker in 2018, two years after Trump won the state. President Joe Biden carried Wisconsin by fewer than 21,000 votes in 2020 and Republicans have made defeating Evers a top priority. Republicans control the Legislature but Evers has blocked their agenda by vetoing a host of bills that would make it more difficult to vote, curb abortion rights and enact Republican-drawn maps following redistricting.//

"What We Still Don't Know About The Jan. 6 Capitol Attack", "Reporter, HuffPost//Reporter, HuffPost//Much of the chaos that unfolded on Jan. 6, 2021, happened in full public view: A desperate President Donald Trump, who had already spent weeks spinning lies about the legitimacy of the presidential election, gathered some of his most fervent supporters outside the White House to hear various friends and family members complain about the results before taking the stage himself.//Vice President Mike Pence appeared to have no intention of following Trump’s instruction to disrupt the formal election certification process that day. Still, Trump described his fever dream to the crowd, saying, “All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify, and we become president, and you are the happiest people.” Trump would be “very disappointed” in Pence if he did not play along. Trump’s supporters, he said, would “never take back our country with weakness.”//“We’re going to try and give our Republicans ― the weak ones, because the strong ones don’t need any of our help ― we’re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country,” Trump said. He concluded: “So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.”//Five people died during the melee and its immediate aftermath. Key questions remain about what Trump knew that day, and what he did during those crucial hours when the U.S. Capitol was overrun by his supporters. And beyond the president, not everyone who instigated or participated in the chaos has been held accountable. News reports and congressional investigations over the past year have filled in some of the gaps to help us understand more about the Capitol attack, but there’s still a lot we don’t know.//After his speech, Trump was promptly shepherded back to the safety of the White House while his supporters began the 45-minute trek to Capitol Hill on foot. Some had gotten a head start. Thousands of people attacked the Capitol because they believed it was what the president of the United States wanted ― many were heard shouting as much ― all while that president was nowhere to be seen for hours.//The House select committee investigating the attack refers often to a period of 187 minutes between the end of Trump’s speech, at 1:10 p.m., and when he posted a video at 4:17 p.m. politely asking the rioters to go home. (Three other Trump tweets posted in that interval reiterated falsehoods about the election and failed to tell protesters to leave the premises.)//Much of that 187-minute block of time is still shrouded in uncertainty.//The leadership of the congressional committee investigating the events of that day revealed this week that they had firsthand testimony confirming one suspicion: that Trump was watching the riot live on television. As his supporters smashed windows, broke open doors and terrorized police officers, Trump watched from his private dining room off of the Oval Office, according to the committee’s vice chair, Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney (R).//We know from an extensive, hour-by-hour report from The Washington Post published in October that Keith Kellogg, Pence’s national security adviser, was on hand urging Trump to take action to stop the attack, but that Trump ignored him. He also resisted pleas from his daughter Ivanka, who came into the dining room at least twice, according to Cheney.//Who else did Trump confer with that afternoon? What did they say?//We know that Trump spoke to three people over the phone. One was by accident; Trump intended to call Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), but instead dialed Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). Both men were huddled in fear of the rioters Trump had sicced on the Capitol, so Lee had only to pass the phone over to his colleague, who reportedly received an earful from Trump about the need to delay the election certification process. Tuberville hung up in order to evacuate. Trump also talked on the phone to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who supposedly urged the president to bring a swift end to the riot. When McCarthy argued that the rioters were Trump supporters, not left-wing agitators, the president replied: “Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,” according to Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.), who overheard the heated exchange.//But we still don’t know what kinds of conversations Trump had with his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, who avoided the subject in his White House memoir, “The Chief’s Chief,” even though documents released by the Jan. 6 committee indicate he was flooded with messages from people trying to get in touch with Trump at the time. (Meadows is no longer cooperating with the Jan. 6 committee.) Trump may have spoken with Jason Miller, a communications aide; The Washington Post report documented tweets instructing the rioters to go home that Miller allegedly drafted but the president did not send. He may also have spoken with his lawyers. One of them, John Eastman, emailed a Pence aide during the attack to pin the blame on the vice president.//At least one person tried to reach the president through his TV. Chris Christie called into ABC News the afternoon of Jan. 6 with a message: “It’s pretty simple. The president caused this protest to occur. He’s the only one who can make it stop.”//A trove of National Archives records requested by the Jan. 6 committee will likely shine more light on everything Trump did the day of the riot. But at the moment, those documents are tied up in court.//The Jan. 6 committee revealed this week that members have evidence Trump was speaking to Fox News host Sean Hannity before, during and after the riot. The panel issued a subpoena for the conservative commentator on Tuesday. The committee chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), alleged in a letter that Hannity had expressed “concerns” and provided “advice” to Trump and White House staff about their plans for Jan. 6, and “had relevant communications while the riot was underway.”//The letter also contained text messages Hannity wrote. In one sent the evening of Jan. 5, Hannity wrote that he was “very worried about the next 48 hours.” Given that the certification was set to take place at 1 p.m. the next day ― within 24 hours ― it remains unclear what Hannity might have been worried about, exactly.//Trump supporters were plotting the events of Jan. 6 weeks and even months before it happened. The signs were right out in the open as well as on more obscure sites; people from across the country were coordinating rides to Washington, D.C., on websites like WildProtest.com and TheDonald.win. They were not shy about calls for violence, either ― BuzzFeed News found “hundreds” of posts discussing bringing firearms to the protest in violation of D.C. gun laws. The day of the riot, law enforcement found guns in cars parked outside the Capitol, and some protesters brought firearms inside.//We know that the White House waged a pressure campaign to get Pence to help overturn the election results, which came to a head on Jan. 6. We know that people inside the White House worked on plans to keep Trump in power using the machinery of the federal government.//What we don’t know is how much White House staff, including Trump himself, knew about the possibility of violence.//While many of the 700-plus people who have been federally charged for participating in the riot appear to have been caught up in the rush of excitement that day, some were also members of organized far-right extremist groups like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. Was there any coordination between those groups and people in Trump’s orbit?//It was a Proud Boy, Dominic Pezzola, who smashed the first window of the Capitol at 2:11 p.m. The first rioters began filtering through the next minute.//A quirk of the building’s defenses have led some to question whether the rioters knew to target certain windows. The vast majority of the Capitol’s 658 single-pane windows were reinforced with bomb-resistant glass during renovations between 2017 and 2019, according a Los Angeles Times report. Only about a dozen were not replaced, for various reasons. Video from the attack shows some of the first rioters to approach the Capitol building made “a beeline” for an area with two unreinforced windows, the Los Angeles Times reported. Did they get lucky? The outlet noted that none of the newly reinforced windows appeared to have shattered ― only the old ones.//Chilling Facebook messages sent to an Oath Keeper who participated in the riot, Thomas Caldwell, also raised questions about the extent of protesters’ planning. According to prosecutors, Caldwell received messages telling him members of Congress were using certain tunnels to flee. “Seal them in,” the message allegedly read. “Turn on the gas.” Court documents did not name the sender.//We still don’t know how a pair of pipe bombs ended up on Capitol Hill. On the evening of Jan. 5, an unknown individual wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, a backpack and black-and-light-grey Nikes with a yellow logo placed the bombs between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. near the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee, respectively, the FBI said. But the agency still has no suspects.//Were the explosives supposed to divert law enforcement attention away from the Capitol building?//As Capitol Police Inspector General Michael Bolton testified in May: “If those pipe bombs were intended to be a diversion, it worked.” Several teams of officers left to investigate the bombs after they were discovered on Jan. 6, leaving just a few behind at the Capitol.//Speaking of deadly weapons, we also don’t know who built the scaffold and noose that was photographed outside the building.//Many threats of violence were not taken more seriously because law enforcement believed them to be “aspirational” ― as in, nothing anyone would actually carry out ― and thus protected by the First Amendment right to free speech, according to detailed reporting from The Washington Post. The reason why is not clear.//“This has been one of the most confounding elements of our investigation,” Post reporter Carol Leonnig told NPR’s Terry Gross. “It’s such a mystery to me because the FBI, after 9/11, was deputized with this exact assignment to watch and monitor extremism and interrupt it before it led to a criminal plot,” she said, referring to the FBI’s network of “fusion centers” that are supposed to monitor and share intelligence across agencies. A lot of the planning messages Leonnig came across discussed what seemed to be clearly illegal activity, such as how to smuggle in guns and how to use secure communication methods after breaking into the Capitol.//“I mean, they did not coordinate,” Leonnig said of the agencies.//As a backdrop to the Capitol attack, the weeks leading up to it were some of the most tense of the Trump administration. Justice Department officials ― including people in charge of the FBI and the attorney general’s office ― were on edge wondering whether Trump would fire their leadership and throw their institutions into turmoil out of frustration over having lost the election.//Former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund attempted to request National Guard help on Jan. 3, but he lacked key information about the extent of the threat and his request was rejected.//Thanks to delays and confusion, around three hours passed between the point when protesters breached the Capitol and when law enforcement began to get a handle on the situation. Officials had recognized the need for National Guard assistance within the first 10 minutes; at 2:22 p.m., D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser requested help from the National Guard on a call with Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy and other law enforcement officials, according to an official record. But the request was not immediately approved by acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller. Law enforcement finally finished their sweep of the Capitol around 8 p.m.//The Washington Post’s investigation underscored previous reports that some top military leaders were concerned about the optics of having the National Guard on hand to block a political protest. Some were concerned that Trump might try to use the National Guard for his own ends.//Military leaders have so far given conflicting accounts of the delay. The Jan. 6 committee will likely provide more concrete and substantial answers in a final report.//There was also a legal insurrection underway leading up to Jan. 6, and it was just as dangerous to democracy, if not as visible. We know Trump pressured local election officials in at least one state ― Georgia ― to “find” enough votes to tip the scales of the election. We know someone under his thumb, former Attorney General William Barr, issued an unusual memo to authorize voter fraud investigations before the results were certified. We know Trump tried to convince Barr’s replacement, acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen, to meddle with the election results over baseless claims of voter fraud.//Was there anything else we don’t know about?//Since Trump’s 2020 loss, Republicans have been working in plain view to stack the deck in their favor. Ahead of future elections, they’ve begun to implement changes to how elections proceed in key swing states around the nation, giving partisan officials more control over elections and making it harder to vote to begin with. They’ve demanded audits that help cast doubt in voters’ minds about the legitimacy of the democratic process.//In the aftermath of Jan. 6, perhaps the biggest unanswered question is just what we can expect in future American elections.//Reporter, HuffPost//

"Biden Blasts ‘Shadow Of Lies’ That Led To Jan. 6 Riot At U.S. Capitol", "Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost//Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost//President Joe Biden, in a speech marking the anniversary of the 2021 U.S. Capitol riot, blasted the “shadow of lies” that led to a failed insurrection meant to nullify his election victory over Donald Trump, and condemned Republicans who continue to indulge Trump’s falsehoods.//Biden’s speech, delivered from Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol, amounted to a count-by-count debunking of Trump’s lies about supposed widespread election fraud and what happened on Jan. 6. He noted that election officials across the country, as well as Trump’s own attorney general, agreed Biden had won one of the most scrutinized elections in history. //“You can’t love your country only when you win,” Biden said. “You can’t obey the law only when it is convenient. You can’t be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.”//Biden did not use the event to push the Democratic Party’s sweeping voting rights legislation ― he plans to travel to Georgia to deliver a speech on the proposed law next week.//“At this moment we must decide what kind of nation we are going to be,” Biden said in Thursday’s remarks. “Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm? Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people? Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?”//“We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation,” he concluded. //Biden returned to one of the signature themes of his presidency, framing the fight over Trump’s lies as part of a struggle against authoritarianism around the world.//“We’re engaged in a new struggle between democracy and autocracy, between the aspirations of the many and the greed of the few, between people’s right of self-determination and self-serving autocrats,” he said. “In China, Russia and beyond, they’re betting democracy’s days are numbered.”//Biden never mentioned Trump by name, instead referring to him as a “defeated former president.” He told reporters after the speech that he’d avoided using Trump’s name because he “did not want to turn it into a contemporary political battle.”//But the political battle came regardless. Trump released a statement claiming Biden was aiming “to further divide America.”//Trump had announced his own plan to hold a press conference on Thursday, but he canceled that event after realizing it was unlikely to draw extensive television coverage.//Biden’s speech is one of several planned events at the Capitol to commemorate the day of the attack and the ultimate certification of the Electoral College vote. Included on the schedule are a prayer vigil, a discussion with historians and a moment of silence. Across the country, right-wing groups are holding their own vigils intended to celebrate the rioters ― though mainstream congressional Republicans are largely avoiding those events.//Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost//
