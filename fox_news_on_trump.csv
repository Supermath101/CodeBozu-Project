Michigan gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon says the sitting Governor is the 'queen of hypocrisy'Representatives of the Department of Justice spoke before a Senate committee Tuesday to report on investigations into the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen reported on the department's ongoing investigations into domestic terrorism. The committee was convened with a focus on the riots that took place at the Capitol last year."I've decided to establish a Domestic Terror Unit to augment our existing approach – this group of dedicated attorneys will focus on the domestic terrorism threat, helping to ensure that these cases are properly handled and effectively coordinated across DOJ and across the country," Olsen announced.SEPTEMBER 11 COMPARISONS ABOUND ON ANNIVERSARY OF CAPITOL RIOT: 'LIKE RETURNING TO THE PENTAGON AFTER 9/11'

Mike Lee of Utah grilled the Justice Department representatives for details and concrete data on a variety of topics related to the Jan. 6 investigations – a series of questions that touched on charges filed, trial outcomes and the demographics of those arrested."Has anyone been charged with the crime of insurrection following Jan. 6?" Lee asked the DOJ representatives, both of whom said they could not answer but were unaware of such charges being filed against anyone involved in the riot.Lee attributed his intense series of questioning to the DOJ's allegedly sluggish and unhelpful response to the senator's previous inquiries outside the legislature.BIDEN IN JAN. 6 SPEECH SHARPLY CRITICIZES TRUMP AS SPREADING ‘WEB OF LIES,' STOKING RIOTSouth Carolina Sen.

"We continue to have concerns about ISIS.""How many people have come across our southern border from special interest countries?" Graham followed up.Both Olsen and Sanborn said that they did not have that information available to them.

Former President Donald Trump's backing of Perdue's primary challenge should quickly help fuel the former senator's campaign coffers. And Abrams – a rising Democratic Party star and voting rights champion – is a fundraising giant who set campaign cash records in her 2018 gubernatorial run and who's voting rights group, Fair Fight, has hauled in over $100 million since then.Four years ago, with the support of Trump, Kemp narrowly defeated Abrams to win the governorship. Abrams, a former state legislative leader, launched her second bid for governor at the start of December.ENCOURAGED BY TRUMP, PERDUE LAUNCHES PRIMARY CHALLENGE AGAINST KEMPPerdue, who declared his candidacy a couple of days after Abrams announcement, jumped into the race after months of encouragement by Trump. His move set up an epic GOP primary battle with the conservative incumbent, who for over a year has faced the former president’s rath for not overturning the 2020 election results in Georgia.

The ballots in the Peach State were counted three times – the original Election Day tally, a mandatory hand recount and a recount requested by the then-president's campaign. Infuriated with the governor, Trump has repeated vowed to return to Georgia to campaign against Kemp for failing to help him overturn the results. And Trump endorsed Perdue a day after the former senator launched his bid.TAKE TWO: STACEY ABRAMS LAUNCHES A 2022 BID FOR GOVERNOR IN GEORGIASaparow emphasized that "Kemp has been working hard in recent months, meeting with voters, donors, and Republicans who care about the future of this state and our country."And he pledged that "our campaign will continue to outwork anyone in the field to ensure we keep Georgia red in 2022." The reporting of Kemp’s reelection campaign cash figures comes a day after the start of the new legislative session in Georgia. While the fundraising filing period for state races doesn’t conclude until the end of this month, the governor’s prevented by Georgia law from raising money while the legislature is in session.Last Thursday Perdue filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Georgia Senate Bill 221, which allows Kemp – as well as a handful of state legislative leaders – to set up leadership funds or committees that can haul in and spend unlimited amounts of campaign cash.

Elizabeth Cheney, the committee's vice chairwoman, is simply being used as a "pawn" by Democrats like Pelosi and Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi."We now know, and it has been confirmed and corroborated by numerous sources right here on this show, that Donald Trump authorized up to 20,000 National Guard soldiers to protect the Capitol. He authorized this two days before January 6. Now, why would he authorize that? Everybody knew a massive demonstration was planned. Everybody knew tensions were running high in the country and given what happened over the summer," Hannity said."Five hundred and seventy-four riots and all these people dead and all these cops hurt. Everyone knew that any large protest would be vulnerable to bad actors. We saw what had just happened in the summer of 2020."
House 1/6 Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi is shown.
Hannity said that once Trump approved the request, it was up to Pelosi and Bowser to take action – but they refused.In that regard, if the committee seriously intends to get to the bottom of January 6, they must subpoena Pelosi and Bowser as intently as they have right-wing individuals – the list of which includes ex-advisers Stephen Bannon and Roger J. Stone, as well as talk show host Alexander Jones."We now know they blocked the National Guard assistance on multiple occasions. They refused to even call up the guard after the Capitol Police chief literally was begging for the National Guard; on at least six separate occasions that we've chronicled. So the question tonight is why? Why? Why not approve the extra security that the president allocated for? Why choose to leave lawmakers vulnerable with such a massive crowd that they knew would be going to the Capitol?"Hannity pointed out that Thompson previously told the press that Pelosi was off-limits, while Cheney recently told Fox News that no one is off-limits."Liz Cheney tried to tell us that nothing was off-limits, but of course, Cheney is powerless in this committee, even though she's vice chair," Hannity said.

Devin Nunes is sharing new details about TRUTH Social and his decision to leave Congress to take on Big Tech as the CEO of Trump Media & Technology Group, vowing to create the "free-est" social media platform for users across the United States and around the world. In an exclusive interview with Fox News, his first since retiring from Congress after nearly two decades representing California's 22nd Congressional District, and after leading the House Intelligence Committee for nearly a decade, Nunes said his new chapter is "not political" but instead a continuation of his public service.TRUMP SAYS NEW MEDIA COMPANY COULD BE UP AND RUNNING BY END OF FIRST QUARTER 2022"I still see what I am doing as a public service. It is not political, but it is public service," Nunes told Fox News. "This has to be done. This is the most important issue at the highest level.""It is really serious what we're doing," he continued. "Millions of Americans and people around the globe are counting on us to get this done and get it done right."Nunes announced his resignation from Congress in December, and soon after was named by former President Trump to be CEO of Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG).Nunes said the move shouldn't come as a surprise, telling Fox News that he has been sounding the alarm on Big Tech suppression and disinformation for the last several years. "It was hard for me to say no because it is the issue I have been most passionate about over the last few years," Nunes said. "You would have to be hiding under a rock to not know my frustration with these Big Tech companies."

(Dylan Hollingsworth/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Nunes said he has "always flirted with technology," noting he was one of the first in Congress to send text messages to constituents, beginning as early as 2009. Nunes also developed the digital arm of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Nunes recalled that he was one of the first elected officials to transition to Rumble – an alternative video platform to YouTube. TMTG last month announced a cloud services partnership with Rumble. "I was the first to be shadow-banned on Twitter. I was the first one to go to Parler and be on the website and app," Nunes said. "This has long been a problem." Nunes pointed to his book "Countdown to Socialism," noting that it is "largely about how the Big Tech companies are stopping average Americans from being able to learn what's happening across numerous sectors – not just politics." "If we don't get some alternative media platforms going, it is going to be really tough," Nunes said. Since Trump was banned from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, a number of Trump allies have waded into the world of technology, attempting to create alternative platforms for conservatives. Former Trump senior adviser Jason Miller launched GETTR, an alternative to Twitter; and even former Trump campaign aide Brad Parscale launched Campaign Nucleus, which was set to have a social media component. 
A screengrab of former President Trump's suspended Twitter page.
But TRUTH Social, which Nunes said is being "finalized right now," is intended to be "only a small part of, ultimately, what we envision this company to be." As for the larger TMTG vision, Nunes said they are taking a "three-pronged approach." "You have TRUTH Social platform, but we are also heavily looking at streaming and having a streaming service, and that is in development right now," Nunes said. "We are also looking at how do we deliver the news, and deliver news to people. That is more conceptual right now." Nunes explained that TRUTH Social is just "the first component" of TMTG, saying that they are focused on making its launch, which is expected in the first quarter of 2022, "successful." "We want to have a really high-quality product, but we are looking at multiple product lines down the road," Nunes said. As for the TRUTH Social platform, Nunes said they want it to "be a safe, and that is key, a safe, family-friendly platform that does not censor based on politics." "So, all of these other companies that are out there that are an alternative to Big Tech, we believe we help them all," Nunes said. "A rising tide lifts all the boats that are fighting against these tech tyrants." TRUMP'S MEDIA COMPANY TO PARTNER WITH RUMBLETRUTH Social, while not yet public, is available for pre-order in the App Store.  Nunes explained that platform offers a message board for users to post their thoughts, and gives them the ability to post photos and videos. "The photo component of this is very slick, very simple, very slick," Nunes said, adding that TRUTH Social will also have verified accounts for public figures. "This is a quality, user-friendly product," Nunes explained, saying that there will not be any algorithms used to prioritize certain posts to certain users. "It will be in chronological order, and the feed will be so that you don't miss what your distant relative posted about their kid's soccer game over the weekend – that's what happens now on your platforms, you're just served so much garbage all the time." He added: "We want this to be something that you're not worried about your kids or your grandparents being on." As for critics, Nunes said: "You ban us and ban the president, okay, we're going to raise the capital and build a company." "It is not a Republican company, but it is going to be a company open to all Americans," Nunes said. "It is going to be the freest platform, for sure, because we are not going to be using these algorithms." "We are going to get the technology right, there is no question" Nunes said, sticking to Trump's timeline. "The key will be, can we handle the growth. This has to be built without the use of any of these companies that would cut us off." He added: "We can't use any of the woke corporations, or private woke corporations, so all of this has to be developed from scratch." Trump Media & Technology Group first launched in October. The company said last month that the partner has agreements for $1 billion in capital from institutional investors. TMTG's plan is to become a publicly listed company through a merger with the publicly traded Digital World Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company whose sole purpose is to acquire a private company and take it public. "One week in, it's clear that TMTG has assembled a robust team of world-class patriots committed to developing TRUTH Social and displacing Big Tech's repressive hold on the digital public square," Nunes told Fox News. "Our team is excited to be in the final stages of development on this critical platform."Nunes went on to tout the former president, saying with TMTG, he is "focused on developing a world-class quality product, similar to his real estate properties and golf courses." "He's already assembled an extraordinary team of developers at TMTG, and we're constantly being approached by incredibly talented applicants," Nunes said, adding that he has "been impressed with his keen eye for detail and focus on creating an unparalleled user experience."As for whether Trump will use his TRUTH Social platform like he did Twitter, Nunes said: "That's up to him." "He will use it however he sees fit, like we hope all Americans will, and, ultimately, we will venture outside the United States also and then there will be additional products," Nunes explained.

I am really excited." Meanwhile, Nunes reflected on his time in Congress after nearly 20 years of service. Nunes was elected in 2002. He served on the House Intelligence Committee beginning in 2011 and served as chair of the panel from 2015 to 2019. Nunes served as ranking member on the committee until his retirement, after Democrats took the majority of the House of Representatives in the 2018 Midterm Elections. Trump, before he left office, awarded Nunes the Presidential Medal of Freedom. NUNES TO RESIGN FROM CONGRESS, JOIN TRUMP MEDIA COMPANY AS CEONunes, who led the committee's Russia investigation, called it a "dark chapter in U.S. history that is still being, in large part, covered up." But reflecting on the investigation that he felt was the most influential, Nunes pointed to the House Intelligence Committee's bipartisan China probe, which he said is still ongoing. "I think that one is the one where we were most out on front, we were doing a really good job, but what happened with the Russia hoax, it destroyed us," he said. "This is not Trump's fault or Republicans' fault, it is the left's fault for derailing the whole country and taking our focus off of what we should have been focusing on, which is this China problem." Nunes said that today, "people are figuring out what a big problem it is." TRUMP LAUNCHES NEW COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORM MONTHS AFTER TWITTER, FACEBOOK BAN"The work we did on China is critically important and will continue to be under Republican leadership," Nunes said. As for memories that stand out most to him, Nunes said it was "special" for him to represent his district at former President Ronald Reagan's funeral. "I was a little kid when Reagan was president, so he was obviously a major figure for me in my life, and that was, I mean, that was surreal for me to attend that funeral on my constituents' behalf," Nunes said. Nunes told Fox News that he will most miss "working with the men and women across the military and intelligence agencies." "I just really had a lot of respect and learned so much from them," Nunes said. "It is really something I will always look back on with fond memories. "I've been to a lot of the good places around the globe with our allies, I've visited most of our major adversaries – it was phenomenal." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn an exclusive interview with Fox News last month, Trump touted Nunes as a "fantastic leader" and expressed his excitement about Nunes' role at TMTG. "He also loves our country and he wants to get another voice out there - -obviously not just for the radical left, so this is a very big thing," Trump told Fox News.

"The Select Committee will respond to this letter in more detail in the coming days and will consider appropriate next steps."The committee also said Jordan was missing the point with the reasons he gave for his refusal – including that he "cannot speak to Speaker Pelosi’s failure to ensure the appropriate security posture at the Capitol complex," or that "a concern about ‘optics,’" contributed to police's "limited security response."

Robert Reich, a former labor secretary, warned in a fundraising pitch for the liberal group MoveOn that Trump wants to "install himself in the White House in 2024" by electing secretaries of state.  "His plot centers around using the 2022 elections to install right-wing loyalists to one of the most obscure, but important, jobs in politics:  Secretary of State — the officials who control voter registration, oversee the counting of the votes, and declare the winners and losers of elections," Reich wrote in the Dec. 26 fundraising pitch announcing MoveOn’s focus on the secretary of state races. "If Trump's plot succeeds, Trump-backed secretaries of state in key battleground states will have the power to disregard the will of the people and throw out the necessary number of ballots — thousands or perhaps millions — to ensure that Trump is declared the winner." STATE DEPARTMENT MOCKED FOR ‘BIZARRE' PROMOTION OF ANTONY BLINKEN'S SPOTIFY PLAYLIST: ‘HUMILIATING’Trump has notably endorsed other down-ballot candidates for state legislature, state agriculture commissioner, lieutenant governor and even one for a county judge, according to a tally by Ballotpedia of Trump-endorsed candidates. Republicans are focusing less on Trump as they contend that Democrats want administrators to change the rules of elections for their own advantages.  "National liberals are ramping up their investments in secretary of state races because they see control of these offices as a way to change the rules to compensate for their inability to win elections with their failed socialist agenda," Andrew Romeo, director of communications for the Republican State Leadership Committee, told Fox News. "The RSLC is focused on continuing to accelerate our fundraising efforts so we can stop them."

But, he predicted victories, noting that election integrity measures such as voter ID are popular with the public.  MIKE POMPEO: US ATHLETES SHOULD BOYCOTT BEIJING OLYMPICS, NOT ‘PROP UP’ XI JINPING"Republicans will be successful in these races because Americans across the country understand now more than ever the importance of having strong secretaries of state who will make it easier to vote and harder to cheat," Romeo added.  The Democratic Association of Secretaries of State, which raises money solely for these races, has cast the upcoming year as about the survival of democracy, saying in a New Year’s Eve fundraising tweet, "There are 27 Secretaries of State races on the ballot in 2022. Help us celebrate the New Year (and more importantly, help us save democracy) by supporting our work here."A media spokesperson for the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State did not respond to inquiries for this story.  The Democratic Association of Secretaries of State expects to raise about $15 million, more than 10 times its previous record, Axios reported. Liberal donor Quinn Delaney and Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank each donated $250,000 to the group.  The Republican State Leadership Committee announced last week that, along with its strategic policy partner the State Government Leadership Foundation, it had raised a total of $33.3 million in 2021, more than doubling the previous off-year record of $14 million in 2019. That will go for the group’s entire portfolio of state candidates.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe liberal group End Citizens United/Let America Vote will spend $7 million to back six Democratic candidates for secretary of state and attorney general in Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Colorado, Michigan and Minnesota, CNN reported in June.  Fox News anchor Bret Baier reacts to the tone of the president's speech marking one year since the Capitol riot.The starting gun in the next White House race doesn’t fire for 10 more months, until after the 2022 midterm elections.But President Biden’s most muscular comments to date regarding former President Donald Trump - as Biden gave a much talked-about address in Statuary Hall marking the one-year anniversary of the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol - appeared to serve as a preview for a potential 2024 rematch between the two leaders.The speech seemed to be a turning point for the president, who during much of his first year in the White House has directly avoided targeting his predecessor in office. But on Thursday, without using Trump’s name, the president accused him of inciting the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 in hopes of disrupting congressional certification of Biden’s Electoral College victory in the 2020 election.2021, THE YEAR THAT THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RACE IGNITED"We must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie. And here is the truth: The former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election," Biden charged, as he pointed to Trump's repeated, unfounded claims that the 2020 election was "RIGGED" and "stolen" due to massive voter fraud."He’s done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interests as more important than his country’s interests and America’s interests, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution," the president argued.

And looking ahead to what sounded like the next presidential election campaign, Biden pledged to "defend this nation. And I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy."Trump, who canceled his originally planned news conference on Jan. 6, fired off numerous statements throughout the day.The former president argued that Biden "used my name today to try to further divide America," labeling it "political theater."And Trump claimed that the president’s speech was "just a distraction for the fact Biden has completely and totally failed."WHAT TRUMP TOLD FOX NEWS ABOUT HIS 2024 TIMETABLELooking ahead to this November’s midterms, when the GOP hopes to win back majorities in the House of Representatives and the Senate, Trump said that "to watch Biden speaking is very hurtful for many people…this is an election year and MAGA Republicans should get elected and work with me to fix this horror."After his address, Biden told reporters that he referred to Trump in his speech as a "former president" rather than directly name him because he "did not want to turn" marking the one-year anniversary of the attack on the Capitol "into a contemporary political battle between me" and Trump. But in some ways, what Biden said on Thursday sounded like the opening shots in the next White House race.
