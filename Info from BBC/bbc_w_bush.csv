"Colin Powell: Former US secretary of state dies of Covid complications", "Tributes are being paid to former US Secretary of State Colin Powell, who has died of Covid-19 complications aged 84. //Tributes are being paid to former US Secretary of State Colin Powell, who has died of Covid-19 complications aged 84. //The former top military officer died on Monday morning, his family said. He was fully vaccinated.//Powell became the first African-American secretary of state in 2001 under Republican President George W Bush.//He also sparked controversy for helping garner support for the Iraq War.//"We have lost a remarkable and loving husband, father, grandfather and a great American," the family said in a statement, thanking the staff at the Walter Reed Medical Center "for their caring treatment".//Powell had previously been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer which may have made him more susceptible to Covid symptoms, according to US media, as well as Parkinson's disease.//President Joe Biden, calling Powell a "dear friend", said he had embodied the "highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat". //Obituary: Colin Powell//Former President Bush was among the first to pay tribute to "a great public servant" as well as "a family man and a friend" who "was such a favourite of presidents that he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom - twice".//Mr Bush's vice-president Dick Cheney saluted Powell as "a man who loved his country and served her long and well" while also being "a trailblazer and role model for so many".//Former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, tweeted that Powell  "understood what was best in this country, and tried to bring his own life, career, and public statements in line with that ideal".//Condoleezza Rice, Powell's successor as secretary of state and the first black woman in the role, called him "a truly great man" whose "devotion to our nation was not limited to the many great things he did while in uniform or during his time spent in Washington". //"Much of his legacy will live on in the countless number of young lives he touched."//Current secretary of state Antony Blinken called Powell's life "a victory of the American Dream". //Powell gave the Department of State "the very best of his leadership," Mr Blinken said. "He never stopped believing in America, and we believe in America in no small part because it helped produce someone like Colin Powell."//Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair - who worked closely with Powell during the early years of the Iraq War -  said he was someone of "immense capability and integrity" who was "a great companion, with a lovely and self-deprecating sense of humour".//Remembrances also poured in from prominent African-American leaders. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton called him "a sincere and committed man", while members of the Congressional Black Caucus praised his "legacy of valour and integrity".//US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin, the first black man to serve in that role, hailed Powell as "a tremendous personal friend and mentor" who would be "impossible to replace".//My father looked up to Colin Powell quite a lot actually. My dad was an army officer and, to him, seeing a black man rise to such a prominent role in the military and further on into appointed office was really powerful for him. I can't speak to this with 100% certainty, but I think that his view of him now is a little bit more conflicted. - Isaiah Reeves, 25, Tennessee//His impact on my decision [as a Jamaican-American] to join the military was significant. At the time of his rise through the military ranks, it was unexpected for a poor Jamaican-American boy from New York City to achieve what he did in life. When he became Secretary of State, I understood there is no limit to what individuals can achieve, regardless of socio-ethnic background. - Michelle Dunkley, 57, New Jersey//Once a moderate Republican, Powell became a trusted military adviser to a number of leading US politicians.//But he broke with his party to endorse Barack Obama in 2008, as well as Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. A sharp critic of Republican president Donald Trump, Powell said he could no longer call himself a Republican after the violent 6 January riot at the US Capitol.//He also saw service and was wounded in Vietnam, an experience that later helped define his own military and political strategies.//However, he would say himself that his own legacy had been damaged by a speech to the United Nations Security Council which used faulty intelligence to back the invasion of Iraq.//"It was painful. It's painful now," Powell told ABC News in 2005.//Colin Powell was an iconic American success story. The child of immigrants, he became the first black man to rise to the highest positions in US military and diplomacy.//In the 1990s, Powell was one of the few American public figures with appeal that crossed political boundaries - reminiscent of General Dwight D Eisenhower after the Second World War.//Unlike Eisenhower, Powell would not ascend to the presidency - although there were abundant calls for him to run.//Those calls dwindled after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, a decision Powell later acknowledged was a "blot" on his legacy. He had staked his reputation on the presence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction - and his reputation suffered for it.//In his later years, Powell became a different kind of icon. His drift away from the Republican Party following Donald Trump's rise to power reflected the dwindling influence of Powell's moderate, internationalist faction within the American conservative movement.//Powell's life may be somewhat overshadowed by his cause of death, as he now ranks as the most prominent American to succumb to Covid-19.

"Donald Rumsfeld: Ex-US defence secretary dies aged 88", "Donald Rumsfeld, the two-time US defence secretary who was one of the main architects of the Iraq war, has died at the age of 88.//Donald Rumsfeld, the two-time US defence secretary who was one of the main architects of the Iraq war, has died at the age of 88.//Serving under President George W Bush, he was a key proponent of the so-called "war on terror" after the 9/11 attacks.//US forces invaded Iraq in 2003 after claiming the country had weapons of mass destruction, but no such weapons were found.//Mr Rumsfeld resigned three years later amid the fallout from the conflict.//He staunchly defended his record, but many experts blamed him for decisions that led to difficulties in Iraq and the wider region. //On Wednesday, his family said he had died at home in the town of Taos, New Mexico. "History may remember him for his extraordinary accomplishments over six decades of public service," they said in a statement.//"But for those who knew him best and whose lives were forever changed as a result, we will remember his unwavering love for his wife Joyce, his family and friends, and the integrity he brought to a life dedicated to country."//Obituary: Donald Rumsfeld //Reacting to the news, President Bush described him as "a man of intelligence, integrity, and almost inexhaustible energy" and an "exemplary public servant" who "never flinched from responsibility". //US defence secretary Lloyd Austin, meanwhile, said: "Secretary Rumsfeld was propelled by his boundless energy, probing intellect, and abiding commitment to serve his country."//Born in Chicago in 1932, Mr Rumsfeld's political and private career spanned decades. He first came to Washington DC in the 1960s and served in multiple positions under presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.//In 1975, he became the youngest person to be named defence secretary and later became the oldest to serve in the role during his second stint under President Bush.   //He was at the Pentagon when the building was hit by a hijacked airplane during the 9/11 attacks. Mr Rumsfeld was among the first to reach the smouldering crash site, and he helped carry the wounded in stretchers.//Less than a month later, US forces began an air campaign against al-Qaeda, the group responsible for the attacks, and the Taliban in Afghanistan, toppling the regime within weeks. //The administration's attention then turned to Iraq, which had played no role in the attacks. Mr Rumsfeld made the case for the March 2003 invasion, arguing that the country's weapons of mass destruction posed a danger to the world. No such weapons were ever found.//Mr Rumsfeld was known for his rollicking news conferences in which he sparred with reporters. One of the most memorable moments came in 2002, when he gave a much-mocked answer about "known knowns" and "known unknowns" after being asked whether there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.//His tenure was also marked by photos that surfaced in 2004 of US personnel abusing prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad, and the treatment of foreign terrorism suspects at a prison set up at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.//Mr Rumsfeld, however, largely remained defiant over his record after leaving office. In a 2011 memoir, which he titled Known and Unknown, he defended his decisions around the Iraq war but did express regret over some of his comments.", 9.1%
"In pictures: A history of US-Russian summits", "When US President Joe Biden meets his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Geneva, Switzerland on Wednesday, their names will enter into the pages of a long history of talks between leaders of the two powers.//When US President Joe Biden meets his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Geneva, Switzerland on Wednesday, their names will enter into the pages of a long history of talks between leaders of the two powers.//Here we look back at some of the summits that preceded this one.//President John F Kennedy met Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna in 1961. The talks were dominated by the crisis in Berlin and control over the divided city. For Kennedy, it was a bruising, unexpectedly hostile encounter at which he felt outmatched by his Soviet counterpart.//"Worst thing in my life," the president told a New York Times reporter after the talks. "He savaged me." The Berlin Wall went up in the months after the talks and the following year the two superpowers locked horns over the Cuban missile crisis.//In May 1972, President Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev met in Moscow for their first summit, which produced what appeared to be a good working relationship between the two leaders and a historic arms treaty setting limits to the rapidly expanding nuclear arsenals of both powers.//Nixon invited Brezhnev to Washington the following year, and the pair signed nuclear arms control treaties at three successive summits.//In November 1974, Nixon's successor Gerald Ford met Brezhnev for the first time in the Russian city of Vladivostok. Relations between the pair were warm despite the extreme cold. They discussed American football and football which they had respectively played as younger men, and joked together.//Ford had come wearing a wolfskin coat from Alaska. "I'm a sheep in wolf's clothing," he joked to reporters. "I told the first secretary. I'm going to get him one." Brezhnev then tried on the coat and modelled it for photographers.//The pair met again the following year in Helsinki - the first of several US-Russian summits that would take place in the Finnish capital - for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.//Leaders from 35 nations signed the Helsinki accords - a declaration which called for respect for human rights and for the inviolability of European borders. It was among the most significant moments of the Cold War, but Ford faced criticism at home for what was seen by some as a concession to the Soviets and a legitimisation of Soviet oppression in Eastern Europe.//Jan Lodal, a member of Ford's policy team at the summit, later wrote in the Atlantic that Brezhnev had secretly told Ford that the Soviets supported his re-election and would "do everything we can to make that happen". It would turn out to be a strange foreshadowing of the build up to another US presidential election, 41 years later.//Towards the end of the Cold War, in December 1987, President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev met in Washington DC, where the two nations once again engaged on the issue of controlling nuclear arms stockpiles and testing. //They signed the INF Treaty - an accord banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles which led to the destruction of 2,692 missiles by 1991.//Then in 2017, shortly before the INF Treaty's 30-year anniversary, President Donald Trump accused Russian leader Vladimir Putin of violating the pact by testing and deploying a ground-launched intermediate-range cruise missile, calling it a "big deal".//Moscow responded by accusing the US of violating the treaty.//President George HW Bush met Mr Gorbachev seven times. By the time they met for their third summit, in Helsinki in September 1990, they had established a warm working relationship based on hours of discussions, often without advisers.//Mr Bush was hoping to shore up support from Mr Gorbachev in dealing with aggression by the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who had weeks earlier invaded Kuwait.//Mr Gorbachev arrived at the summit with a gift for Mr Bush - a framed cartoon depicting the two leaders as boxers, both standing in a victory stance, having knocked out a prone figure labelled "Cold War" in Russian.//President Bill Clinton met Russian leader Boris Yeltsin in Helsinki in March 1997 for talks viewed as some of the most crucial between the US and Russia since the end of the Cold War. Relations had been strained by an eastward expansion of Nato to include former Soviet bloc nations.//Yeltsin made it clear at the summit that he objected to Nato enlargement, but agreed to negotiate a pact with the alliance. The pair also agreed to a sharp reduction in their respective nuclear arsenals. //US-Russia relations steadily worsened under the leadership of Vladimir Putin, a former Russian intelligence official who became president in 2000. George W Bush, who became US president a year later, attempted to bring Mr Putin on side but the pair's relationship slowly soured over the eight years Mr Bush was in office.//"I think Putin is not a democrat anymore," he told the visiting prime minister of Slovenia in 2006. "He's a tsar. I think we've lost him."//When Barack Obama became US president in 2009, he tried a new strategy of going around Mr Putin. The Russian leader had stepped aside to comply with Russia's two-term presidential limit, installing Dmitry Medvedev in his place.//Mr Obama did travel to Moscow to meet Mr Putin in 2009, and again at a Mexican G20 summit in 2012. On the second occasion, Mr Putin showed up late for the meeting, which focused on the prospects of peace settlement in Syria.//But President Obama attempted to develop a relationship with Mr Medvedev.//In 2009, Mr Obama dispatched his Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to meet her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov with the goal of re-setting US-Russia relations. She even went armed with a toy button labelled "reset" in English and Russian, only for it to be revealed that the Russian word they'd used in fact meant "overload".//Russia later pointedly refused US demands for them to extradite the whistleblower Edward Snowden. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to Moscow and distanced himself from Mr Putin. //Then in 2014 Russia annexed Crimea, breaking for the first time the Helsinki Accord signed by Ford and Brezhnev in 1975 and heaping international opprobrium and sanctions on itself. President Obama criticised Mr Putin, but made it clear he had no intention of entering into any kind of conflict.//"This is not another cold war that we're entering into," he said. "Now is not the time for bluster â¦ There are no easy answers, no military solution."//When Mr Trump became president in 2016, the US once again sought a reset. //A 16 July summit in the Finnish capital, Helsinki, was arranged with US-Russia relations under a heavy raincloud. US intelligence agencies unanimously concluded that Russia conducted a cyber operation to influence the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.//A special counsel was tasked with investigating the alleged Russian interference and if Mr Trump's campaign was complicit. A report released by the special counsel in April 2019 concluded that Mr Trump's campaign team did not collude with Russia to influence the election.//In a news conference, President Trump defended Russia over the claims. He contradicted US intelligence agencies by suggesting Russia had no reason to meddle in the election.//This video can not be played//Mr Trump also blamed poor relations with Russia on past US administrations rather than actions taken by President Putin's government.//In the wake of the summit, Mr Trump faced a barrage of criticism from both sides of the US political divide for his defence of Russia.//In the end, Mr Putin said the ball was in Mr Trump's court, and gifted the US president a World Cup football.//.//Â© 2022 BBC.

"Wikipedia at 20: The encyclopedia in five articles", "On 15 January 2001, two American entrepreneurs - Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger - launched an online encyclopedia. //On 15 January 2001, two American entrepreneurs - Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger - launched an online encyclopedia. //It was called Wikipedia. Despite much criticism early on about inaccuracies, it has gone on to be hugely successful. //It is the 15th most popular destination on the web, is available in more than 300 languages and is maintained by a community of volunteer editors. //At least, I think that is accurate - I found all those facts in the online encyclopedia's own entry on Wikipedia. //It is where everyone from students, to politicians to yes, journalists, turn for a quick briefing on any subject, although even Wikipedia says it should not be used as a primary source. //But here are five articles with the now ubiquitous prefix https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki, that tell the story of this phenomenon.//George W Bush was inaugurated as the 43rd president of the United States five days after the launch of Wikipedia. //His Wiki entry went on to provide a fundamental challenge to its core principle: openness. //"Anyone can hit edit," explains David Gerard, who has been a volunteer editor since the early days. //"I hope that people understand that Wikipedia is just a bunch of well-meaning amateurs, doing our best to make something nice." //But not everyone wanted to play nice. //The vicious edit war about the Bush entry, where disputed lines about controversies such as the Gulf War were entered and removed time and again, was one factor which saw a change in the rules. //Some entries were protected, meaning there were limits on editing, particularly from new or anonymous users.//Jimmy remembers that one idealistic administrator was so unhappy about this that he said he would unlock the Bush page and look after it.//"After eight hours of dealing with nonsense, he said: 'I'm locking it, that's fine.'"//It was on 5 January 2020 that a Wikipedia editor, who lists their country as China and current location as Cambridge, created a page with the title: 2019-2020 China pneumonia outbreak. //The title changed once the virus became known as Covid-19.//Over the last year, hundreds of editors have contributed to what now amounts to a short book about every aspect of the pandemic.  //The internet has been awash with disinformation about the virus, but David says Wikipedia's policy on reputable sources for medical information keeps up the quality.//"The standard is 'studies of studies' -  single papers aren't usually acceptable," he explains.//This does not stop battles breaking out between editors.//One comment in the edit history reads: "This is speculation. There is zero direct evidence that this happened, therefore it should not be included here." //But Jimmy says Wiki Project Medicine - a community of doctors and scientists formed in the early days of the encyclopedia - has helped keep the Covid page pretty accurate.//The article has also had quite a light form of edit protection since May 2020, meaning you have to have been an editor for four days and have done 10 edits elsewhere before you are allowed to tinker with it. //David says it is unusual to have restrictions imposed for so long.//"We really don't like locking or even half-locking articles long term, but we will if it's something serious," he says.//This page about an American mathematician whose work was fundamental to the development of the GPS navigation system is one of more than 1,000 created by Dr Jess Wade, a physicist at Imperial College London. //Wikipedia has long had problems with diversity, both in the subjects it includes and in its editors - who have been predominantly male and white. //Jess has been part of a movement to change that, in her case focusing on making women scientists more prominent. //"I've been editing Wikipedia for three years, and I've written biographies of women and people of colour every single day," she says.//The Gladys West page was among her first and, since it appeared, the mathematician has been inducted into the US Air Force Hall of Fame. //"Now whenever people talk about the history of GPS I see people on social media saying: 'What about Gladys West?'"//But she says there is still plenty of work to do. //A browser plug-in which tells you about the gender balance on a Wikipedia page shows that just 1.6% of the pronouns on the entry for the History of Physics are "she". //"Donna Strickland, the recent Nobel laureate, or Jocelyn Bell Burnell, who won the Breakthrough Prize for science, all of these phenomenal women physicists, are left out of that story," she says. //For many years the George W Bush page was the one with the most edits, but now it has been overtaken by this one. //The list of WWE professional wrestlers has had more than 53,000 edits over the years. //But although the "sport" attracts its fair share of controversy it seems its number one spot is less about fights between editors, than the passion of its fans. //They come here to log every single wrestler who has ever climbed into the ring, along with their managers and every other person connected to WWE. //Wikipedia may be the place you go to try to puzzle out quantum computing or find out how many US presidents have been impeached, but all human life is here. //At least until an editor decides an entry is just too trivial for inclusion and suggests it should be deleted. //And that is what nearly happened to this page, which Jimmy has nominated as his favourite. //"It's about the theory of humour that some words are just funnier than others," he explains. //But for a while the page was nominated for deletion.//"It had become a place where people just added nonsense words or words they thought sounded funny with no references." //But it was saved and has become quite a scholarly entry, with examples of academic research on what makes a word funny. //So did it survive because the founder liked it? //Not according to David. //He describes Wikipedia as both totally anarchic with nobody in charge, and a complex bureaucracy you have to learn to navigate.//So far, anarchic bureaucracy seems to be working.

"US election 2020: Does this compare to 2000 Florida recount?", "Hours after polls closed in the US election, as votes were being counted, Donald Trump claimed fraud - without providing evidence - and said: "We'll be going to the US Supreme Court."//Hours after polls closed in the US election, as votes were being counted, Donald Trump claimed fraud - without providing evidence - and said: "We'll be going to the US Supreme Court."//To date, the only election that hinged on a US Supreme Court decision was in 2000 when Al Gore was defeated by George W Bush. //So it's tempting to make comparisons between the two elections but they can be misleading. //The 2000 election came down to one state - Florida - where both candidates were separated by only a few hundred votes. By contrast, Donald Trump has filed lawsuits in several states, and the margins with his rival Joe Biden are far greater.//In one of the closest and most controversial votes in US history, Democratic Vice-President Al Gore was pitted against the Republican governor of Texas and son of a former US president, George W Bush.//Opinion polls had suggested that the race would be close. As the night wore on, it became clear that the result rested on Florida and its 25 votes [now 29] in the electoral college (the system the US uses to elect its president).//As ballots were counted, US networks initially called the state for Al Gore. However, they later retracted that, saying that the result was too close to predict. Then, hours later, networks one by one declared that George W Bush had won Florida. However it soon emerged that the vote was on such a knife edge that it was too close to call.//The dramatic seesawing of the night was heightened when Mr Gore rang Mr Bush to concede - and then rang him back to retract his concession.//Because of the close margin - on election night Mr Bush led by 1,784 votes - an automatic recount was called under Florida law and began the next day. It reduced the margin to 327 votes. The Gore campaign then requested manual recounts in individual counties, which went ahead amid much legal wrangling.//With the nation's eyes turned on Florida, news networks carried footage of scrutineers examining "hanging chads" - the small pieces of paper created when a hole was punched in a ballot on the voting machines of the time.//When some voters had punched their ballots, the chad had not fully separated from the ballot, making their preference unclear. In other cases, an indentation had been made in the ballot but it had not been punched through, which was known as a pregnant or dimpled chad.//The confusion over the chads was discussed at length by the highest lawyers in the land and around every kitchen table.//Some Republican supporters in Florida staged a violent protest in Miami, calling for the recount to be stopped. Although the protesters claimed to be "local", most were later identified as Republican aides from Congress in Washington. The protest became known as the "Brooks Brothers Riot" - a nod to the smart suits and ties worn by those involved.//Witness History: The 'hanging chads' US election of 2000//The turmoil ended when the US Supreme Court ruled in Bush's favour, saying that the recount would cast "a needless and unjustified cloud" over his legitimate election. The final margin was 537 votes out of a total of almost six million cast in the state.//Mr Gore conceded, saying that while he disagreed with the court's decision, he accepted it.//"I accept the finality of this outcome which will be ratified next Monday in the electoral college. And tonight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession," he said.//Although he lost the election, Mr Gore took 48.38% of the nationwide total vote to Mr Bush's 47.87%.//In the 2000 recount there were ballots with "hanging chads" to argue over. Today there are only allegations of fraud - for which there is no evidence.//President Trump's legal team has filed lawsuits in at least five states. His unsubstantiated claim is that there has been "major fraud on our nation". He has long cast doubt on mail-in voting, referencing voter fraud or "rigged" elections since April, without providing concrete proof. //Election law experts say voter fraud is rare and only affects a tiny number of votes.//Does US postal voting lead to fraud?The most viral US vote claims debunked//Mr Trump currently tails Mr Biden by thousands or tens of thousands of votes in the contested states. //In Georgia, Mr Trump is behind by about 14,000 votes. That is small enough to warrant an automatic recount, as per state laws, but it is considered highly unlikely that the result will flip. //There have been three reversals through recounts - a Minnesota Senate race in 2008, the election of a Washington governor in 2004, and a Vermont auditor's race in 2006 - and in each case the initial margin was fewer than 500 votes. //Mr Trump would have to flip more than Georgia to reach the 270 electoral college votes needed to secure the presidency. //Lawyers who fought on both sides of the 2000 presidential recount have come out to say this year's situation is no parallel. //"Basically, the election is over. There isn't anything that has come out that could plausibly affect the outcome," David Boies, who led Gore's legal team in 2000, told USA Today newspaper. "There's no legal avenue for the Trump campaign to plausibly dispute the results in any one state."//How is President Trump challenging the result?What Trump could do after leaving the White HouseWhat happens now? //James Baker, the former secretary of state who led Mr Bush's team, also objected to Mr Trump's initial calls to "stop the vote", when the president suggested that counting postal votes that arrived after election day was "illegal". (In Pennsylvania, the state's court had extended the time for receiving absentee ballots by three days, owing to the coronavirus pandemic, as long as the ballots were postmarked by election day.)//Mr Baker said: "Our whole argument [in 2000] was that the votes have been counted and they've been counted and they've been counted and it's time to end the process." //Some senior Republicans - including Senate leader Mitch McConnell - have, however, defended the president's right to pursue legal options.//Mr Trump has repeatedly vowed to take his cases to the US Supreme Court. //But it's not as simple as that. //Usually, legal teams would first have to challenge the results in state-level courts - although US Attorney General William Barr has also approved "preliminary inquiries" by federal prosecutors.//State judges would then have to uphold the challenge and order a recount.//The Supreme Court could then be asked to weigh in.//However, there must be legitimate federal or constitutional questions at the heart of the complaint. //The attorney general wrote earlier this week that inquiries could be made by federal prosecutors "if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities".//There is, as yet, no clarity on the claims being made. //Watch the moment BBC projects Biden victoryWhat happens now?Making history - the first woman vice-presidentWhat Biden's victory means for rest of worldElection results in full", 6.6%

When she played in the road, she told anyone who'd listen that she was going to be famous one day, that she would make millions, and she'd help her whole family. But that outgoing persona had to be contained every now and then, her mother would tell her, especially on a day like this Tuesday. //As they approached the grounds of Emma E. Booker Elementary school, only a short walk away, Natalia was in awe of the scene.//"There were limousines everywhere. There were police on horses," she says. "I thought 'Oh my God!' There were men in suits and sunglasses, the secret service, it was like a scene out of Men in Black. And there were so many white people."//School was an extension of home for Natalia. Her aunt Josephine worked in the cafeteria there, and it was less than a minute's walk. This was the first time Natalia had seen so many unfamiliar faces in the area. //Ushered through a metal detector, Natalia was taken to a classroom where rows of chairs were positioned facing the whiteboards. These were for her and 15 of her second grade classmates. She took a seat on the edge of the row. Behind her were several adults, all in suits, whom she didn't recognise - and many stood next to cameras, all pointed toward her and her friends. //"And then Mrs Daniels walked in and I wasâ¦ 'Wow!'" Natalia laughs. "She always looked pretty but today, wow, she looked beautiful. Beautiful."//Kay Daniels, had her hair freshly curled, and more makeup than usual. She had been Natalia's teacher since she started school and she was a firm favourite of the class.//"Mrs Daniels made an effort with everyone to make sure they learned. She taught on your level," Natalia says.//On seeing familiar faces again, Natalia relaxed. The children fell into easy chatter with each other, giggling at how smart each of them looked. All their parents had taken extra care. //Just before 09:00, the room fell silent as the children were instructed to stand up to welcome a special guest. //President George W Bush walked into the classroom. As cameras clicked at the back of the room, he stopped in front of Natalia to shake her hand. //"I was not expecting this," she says. //Smiling at the children, he moved to the front of the class where he took a seat opposite Kay Daniels, who then began a lesson with the class, which included reading from a book called The Pet Goat. //A few minutes into the class, Andrew Card, the White House chief of staff walked up to the president and bent down to whisper something into his ear. //"After that moment, the president just checked out," says Natalia. "He was gone. He mentally just left the room, he turned bright red. We thought he may have needed to pee real bad."//What Natalia didn't see was that White House press secretary Ari Fleischer had positioned himself behind her, holding a card towards the president, with a message written on it: "Don't Say Anything Yet."//For the next seven minutes the president sat in the room, before he praised the children for their reading skills and excused himself to leave, ahead of the scheduled time.//Moments later the class would learn why. And years after that, Natalia would see herself in news reports and documentaries, on the edge of the frame, just before Andy Card bent down to George W Bush and whispered: "A second plane has hit the second tower. America is under attack."//Newtown isn't mentioned in tourist sites or glossy travel brochures. In 2019, according to the Visit Sarasota website, the city had more than 2.7 million tourists from around the world coming to enjoy its white sand Gulf Coast beaches. But head directly north for around two miles, past the city's business centre, and you'll reach Newtown, where Natalia was born. It's different there.//"It's the 'black area'," she says. "It is about 10 blocks that are entirely black, almost 100%, and it's very different to the rest of Sarasota, which is wealthy - it has golf clubs and country clubs. That's the white area. It's separate."//Natalia was born into a large and loving family and brought up by her biological mother's sister, who was unable to have children of her own.//"I had two mothers," says Natalia. "And lots of aunts and uncles, two sisters and a brother and many cousins. We were in and out of each other's houses and it was a great childhood. And our teachers were like extra aunties and uncles."//Emma E. Booker school was a central part of the community. It had been named after one of the first African American teachers in Sarasota, who was determined to ensure black children had a good environment in which to learn. In 2001, children at the elementary school were overperforming in the state in terms of literacy, and this had been flagged up to the politicians in Washington. //To promote his administration's recent promise to ensure education was equally available to America's diverse communities, George W Bush had then arranged to visit, and 16 pupils with good reading skills were chosen to meet him.//The president walked in minutes after hearing that a plane had crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center. He was seated opposite Mrs Daniels and facing the children, when the second plane hit the south tower at 09:03. Two minutes later that information was relayed to the president, and after remaining in his seat for a while as the children read, he got up to leave.//"I thought, 'What happened? Did I do something wrong, did I say something wrong?'" Kay Daniels says.//"It got strange after that," Natalia says.//"Someone bought a TV into the room and put on the news and that's when we saw what had happened.//"As a kid watching the buildings on fire, watching people jumping out of buildings, screaming, yelling, it was traumatising. Most of us began to cry."//Mrs Daniels switched the TV off, turned to the children and began to sing a gospel song, Hold On, Change is Coming. It would be a song the students would sing together many times while they remained at the school.//News programmes all over the globe picked up the statements President Bush gave in the cafeteria of the school less than half an hour later, addressing what he knew about the largest foreign attacks on American soil. He left soon after, and with him went the cameras, horses and men in black. //One by one the parents of the children arrived to take them home, the teachers soon followed and by noon the school was empty. //In the weeks that followed, Natalia felt more eyes on her. While she played with her friends or siblings, she could see adults in the area, be it an auntie or a neighbour, regularly taking turns to step outside to look out for the children. //"The media made out that America was now a place where people were angry and scared but I saw people in Newtown come together and look out for each other more. I felt taken care of," she says. //There were camera crews around the neighbourhood, and local and international media asked the children to speak about their experiences. Natalia and the others who were in the room that day bonded as they visited news stations and met reporters.//"We did interview after interview after interview," she says. "They were all asking the same questions: 'What was the president thinking?' 'What was the president saying?' 'How did the president look?' We didn't say much, we were kids."//Years later, Natalia read accounts of the day that didn't tally with what she had seen with her own eyes. //She read articles that said the president remained calmly reading from The Pet Goat after the terror attack. In fact, he didn't read to the children at all.//"If they could get that detail wrong, when there were so many cameras present, what else could they get wrong?"//She also took issue with those who criticised the president for his behaviour that day.//"It wasn't fair to say he was just casually sitting there doing nothing while America was under attack," she says. He left as soon as he could without causing the children to worry, she says.//And she disliked the way the children were sometimes described just as "inner-city kids", which felt reductive, or how it was assumed they came from troubled backgrounds and couldn't possibly succeed in life.//The group of children stayed close all through primary and middle school, and in a happy turn of events,  Mrs Daniels remained their teacher and taught them several years after second grade. But by high school the group began to drift apart, and were only recently all reunited when a documentary crew asked them to appear in 9/11 Kids, a film about where they all are now.//"The children in that classroom represent all of America," says Elizabeth St. Philip, the director.//"There is no one singular story there. One joined the military, inspired by the events of that day, one earns six figures as a business consultant, another is sadly in jail. //"This is a unique generation. They watched people die on TV at primary school and came of age through the rise of social media, the economic crash of 2008, the first black president and the polarisation of recent years, including Black Lives Matter. And they aren't even 30 yet!" //Tensions between the community and the police emerge as one of the key themes of the film, and Natalia has first hand experience of them. Growing up, she says she saw cousins being beaten by police for not carrying ID. She says police would stop her and her friends in the area and imitate and mock their accent. //"We were a joke to them," she says. "Our culture was a joke to the police."//Crime rates in Newtown are some of the highest in the state of Florida, a statistic that some community leaders, and Natalia, put down to the area being "over-policed".//"It's the kind of area where if you call them for help, it'd take them about an hour to get to you," Natalia says. "But if you have a party, the police will be there in five minutes to arrest people for small amounts of drugs."//The tensions came to a head in 2018, when Natalia's brother, Jeremy, a state football player with a scholarship to university, was shot three times by a police officer. He was 19, unarmed, and sitting in his car with a friend. //Jeremy survived the attack but was subsequently jailed for a minor drug offence, which Natalia says is often what happens when young black men are targeted by the police. His arrest prompted Black Lives Matter protests in Newtown.//"They found a way to lock him up," she says. "He had his whole career in front of him with his football. When he's out we have to get him back on track and make sure he can fulfil that."//Natalia is now 26, and lives in Newtown with her boyfriend and her two children. She runs a babysitting business, caring for children in the community and helps out in a pop-up business making and selling teddy bears. Her mother, Stephanie, died of a longstanding illness in August, a blow to a family still reeling from Jeremy's imprisonment.//"Right now everyone is on a pause," she says. "But I'm keeping my mindset optimistic. I'm not angry. I honestly feel I'm destined for greatness and when I rise, I'll take my family with me."  //Natalia's experience of reading reports of 9/11, and hearing inaccurate stories about her brother's arrest, means she doesn't believe everything people say, or what they write in the media, or on social media. She is careful about coming to conclusions.//"I don't make snap decisions. I weigh everything up." //Thinking things through for herself, she has even found herself defending politicians, including President Trump, to her friends. //"I think he's made life easier for people to start businesses and the economy was good under him," she says. "But he's done a whole lot of bad too."//Although more than a quarter of a million voters under 30 in Natalia's home state of Florida have already cast votes in this election - five times more than in 2016 - she isn't sure how, or if, she'll vote. She's voted in the past but things feel different this time.//A simple guide to the US electionHow is Donald Trump doing in the polls?Who will be the next US president? You decideWhere Trump and Biden stand on guns, race and climateFull coverage of the US election//"I've seen what it's like to have politicians and the media come by our communities every four years and pretend that they care - and nothing changes," she says. "The people wanting our votes aren't from and don't speak for the community."//Natalia thinks something has changed since 2001, when the media and politicians "controlled the narrative" - the rise of social media, for one thing, and the Black Lives Matter movement. "Now we're getting to have our voices heard and our generation has lots of ways to express ourselves," she says.//Florida is one of the most influential swing states in US presidential elections; how it votes is a strong indication of who the next president will be - its choice has been the country's choice in the case of the last six presidents. Natalia's vote most definitely counts.//"I don't want to say that votes don't count, they do count, but at the end of the day will they make the change of what we want to see happen in our communities - or do we have to do that ourselves?"//James Smith has never wanted much to do with the police but he called them to check on his neighbour in the Texas city of Fort Worth, because it was late at night and her front door was wide open. Soon afterwards he heard a gunshot, and later saw the dead body of a 28-year-old woman, his neighbour's daughter, carried out on a stretcher.//'Why I will no longer call the police'", 9.3%
