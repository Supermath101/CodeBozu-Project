"In pictures: A history of US-Russian summits", "When US President Joe Biden meets his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Geneva, Switzerland on Wednesday, their names will enter into the pages of a long history of talks between leaders of the two powers.//When US President Joe Biden meets his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Geneva, Switzerland on Wednesday, their names will enter into the pages of a long history of talks between leaders of the two powers.//Here we look back at some of the summits that preceded this one.//President John F Kennedy met Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna in 1961. The talks were dominated by the crisis in Berlin and control over the divided city. For Kennedy, it was a bruising, unexpectedly hostile encounter at which he felt outmatched by his Soviet counterpart.//"Worst thing in my life," the president told a New York Times reporter after the talks. "He savaged me." The Berlin Wall went up in the months after the talks and the following year the two superpowers locked horns over the Cuban missile crisis.//In May 1972, President Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev met in Moscow for their first summit, which produced what appeared to be a good working relationship between the two leaders and a historic arms treaty setting limits to the rapidly expanding nuclear arsenals of both powers.//Nixon invited Brezhnev to Washington the following year, and the pair signed nuclear arms control treaties at three successive summits.//In November 1974, Nixon's successor Gerald Ford met Brezhnev for the first time in the Russian city of Vladivostok. Relations between the pair were warm despite the extreme cold. They discussed American football and football which they had respectively played as younger men, and joked together.//Ford had come wearing a wolfskin coat from Alaska. "I'm a sheep in wolf's clothing," he joked to reporters. "I told the first secretary. I'm going to get him one." Brezhnev then tried on the coat and modelled it for photographers.//The pair met again the following year in Helsinki - the first of several US-Russian summits that would take place in the Finnish capital - for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.//Leaders from 35 nations signed the Helsinki accords - a declaration which called for respect for human rights and for the inviolability of European borders. It was among the most significant moments of the Cold War, but Ford faced criticism at home for what was seen by some as a concession to the Soviets and a legitimisation of Soviet oppression in Eastern Europe.//Jan Lodal, a member of Ford's policy team at the summit, later wrote in the Atlantic that Brezhnev had secretly told Ford that the Soviets supported his re-election and would "do everything we can to make that happen". It would turn out to be a strange foreshadowing of the build up to another US presidential election, 41 years later.//Towards the end of the Cold War, in December 1987, President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev met in Washington DC, where the two nations once again engaged on the issue of controlling nuclear arms stockpiles and testing. //They signed the INF Treaty - an accord banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles which led to the destruction of 2,692 missiles by 1991.//Then in 2017, shortly before the INF Treaty's 30-year anniversary, President Donald Trump accused Russian leader Vladimir Putin of violating the pact by testing and deploying a ground-launched intermediate-range cruise missile, calling it a "big deal".//Moscow responded by accusing the US of violating the treaty.//President George HW Bush met Mr Gorbachev seven times. By the time they met for their third summit, in Helsinki in September 1990, they had established a warm working relationship based on hours of discussions, often without advisers.//Mr Bush was hoping to shore up support from Mr Gorbachev in dealing with aggression by the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who had weeks earlier invaded Kuwait.//Mr Gorbachev arrived at the summit with a gift for Mr Bush - a framed cartoon depicting the two leaders as boxers, both standing in a victory stance, having knocked out a prone figure labelled "Cold War" in Russian.//President Bill Clinton met Russian leader Boris Yeltsin in Helsinki in March 1997 for talks viewed as some of the most crucial between the US and Russia since the end of the Cold War. Relations had been strained by an eastward expansion of Nato to include former Soviet bloc nations.//Yeltsin made it clear at the summit that he objected to Nato enlargement, but agreed to negotiate a pact with the alliance. The pair also agreed to a sharp reduction in their respective nuclear arsenals. //US-Russia relations steadily worsened under the leadership of Vladimir Putin, a former Russian intelligence official who became president in 2000. George W Bush, who became US president a year later, attempted to bring Mr Putin on side but the pair's relationship slowly soured over the eight years Mr Bush was in office.//"I think Putin is not a democrat anymore," he told the visiting prime minister of Slovenia in 2006. "He's a tsar. I think we've lost him."//When Barack Obama became US president in 2009, he tried a new strategy of going around Mr Putin. The Russian leader had stepped aside to comply with Russia's two-term presidential limit, installing Dmitry Medvedev in his place.//Mr Obama did travel to Moscow to meet Mr Putin in 2009, and again at a Mexican G20 summit in 2012. On the second occasion, Mr Putin showed up late for the meeting, which focused on the prospects of peace settlement in Syria.//But President Obama attempted to develop a relationship with Mr Medvedev.//In 2009, Mr Obama dispatched his Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to meet her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov with the goal of re-setting US-Russia relations. She even went armed with a toy button labelled "reset" in English and Russian, only for it to be revealed that the Russian word they'd used in fact meant "overload".//Russia later pointedly refused US demands for them to extradite the whistleblower Edward Snowden. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to Moscow and distanced himself from Mr Putin. //Then in 2014 Russia annexed Crimea, breaking for the first time the Helsinki Accord signed by Ford and Brezhnev in 1975 and heaping international opprobrium and sanctions on itself. President Obama criticised Mr Putin, but made it clear he had no intention of entering into any kind of conflict.//"This is not another cold war that we're entering into," he said. "Now is not the time for bluster â¦ There are no easy answers, no military solution."//When Mr Trump became president in 2016, the US once again sought a reset. //A 16 July summit in the Finnish capital, Helsinki, was arranged with US-Russia relations under a heavy raincloud. US intelligence agencies unanimously concluded that Russia conducted a cyber operation to influence the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.//A special counsel was tasked with investigating the alleged Russian interference and if Mr Trump's campaign was complicit. A report released by the special counsel in April 2019 concluded that Mr Trump's campaign team did not collude with Russia to influence the election.//In a news conference, President Trump defended Russia over the claims. He contradicted US intelligence agencies by suggesting Russia had no reason to meddle in the election.//This video can not be played//Mr Trump also blamed poor relations with Russia on past US administrations rather than actions taken by President Putin's government.//In the wake of the summit, Mr Trump faced a barrage of criticism from both sides of the US political divide for his defence of Russia.//In the end, Mr Putin said the ball was in Mr Trump's court, and gifted the US president a World Cup football.//.//Â© 2022 BBC.

He was then pardoned in the last weeks of Mr Trump's presidency.//Mr Stone was arrested in January 2019 in connection with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. //A political veteran, Mr Stone has worked with Republicans since the 1970s and even bears a tattoo of Richard Nixon on his back.//But who is the self-described "dirty trickster" and why was he put on trial?//Roger Stone was found guilty of seven criminal counts of lying to the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee, obstructing justice and witness tampering.//His conviction is connected to statements he made about the Trump campaign's efforts to obtain emails hacked by Russia to undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.//These emails were published by WikiLeaks.//Some of the lies were about the existence of certain emails and texts. Others related to Mr Stone's conversations with Trump campaign officials and a reported "intermediary" with WikiLeaks in early 2016. //Prosecutors said he lied about the date of those conversations, and the identity of the intermediary.//Trump ally Roger Stone convicted of lying to CongressDisgraced Trump aide runs for CongressTrump pledges to 'investigate the investigators'//Mr Stone was also convicted of tampering with a witness - comedian Randy Credico, whom Mr Stone told Congress was the WikiLeaks back channel - when they were called to testify before Congress and speak with the FBI.//In messages Mr Stone sent to Mr Credico, he told him to "prepare to die", and called him "a rat". Mr Stone also told him: "Stonewall it. Plead the Fifth. Anything to save the plan."//Both Mr Stone and Mr Credico have since said that Mr Credico was not the WikiLeaks intermediary.//During the trial, prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky told the jury that Stone - whose activities had long been scrutinised by both the FBI and the Senate - lied "because the truth looked bad for the Trump campaign".//Mr Stone denied the charges, but was convicted on 15 November 2019. //Sentencing him on 20 February, Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Mr Stone had engaged in "intolerable" "threatening and intimidating conduct" toward her.//In addition to the jail sentence, Mr Stone had been due to serve two years' probation after his custodial sentence. He was also fined $20,000 (Â£15,500). //Born in Connecticut in 1952, Mr Stone first got involved in politics at the age of eight, agitating for Democratic candidate John F Kennedy. //"I remember going through the cafeteria line and telling every kid that Nixon was in favour of school on Saturdays," the strategist told the Washington Post in a 2007 interview. "It was my first political trick."//But Mr Stone would begin his professional career helping out on Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign.//Congressional hearings in 1973 called to investigate the Watergate scandal reportedly revealed Mr Stone had hired a Republican operative to infiltrate Democratic candidate George McGovern's campaign, and sabotaged a Republican challenger to Nixon.//The revelations cost him his job for then-Senator Bob Dole, but Mr Stone insists he did not break any law. //"The reason I'm a Nixonite is because of his indestructibility and resilience," he told the New Yorker in an interview, shortly after he had the 37th president's face tattooed between his shoulder blades.//"Women love it," he said.//Stone went on to work on Ronald Reagan's successful presidential runs in 1980 and 1984, and aided George HW Bush's election in 1988. //But Richard Nixon still seems to hold special significance for Mr Stone - aside from the tattoo, he has a room of Nixon memorabilia in his office in Oakland Park, Florida. //In the 1990s, Mr Stone worked as a lobbyist for Donald Trump's casino business, and later helped Mr Trump's unsuccessful White House run in 2000.//According to the Netflix documentary Get Me Roger Stone, the strategist reportedly encouraged Mr Trump to run for the presidency. //While serving on Mr Trump's campaign in 2015 the pair allegedly had a falling out - Mr Stone says he quit, while Mr Trump said he had fired the operative. //But days later Mr Stone wrote a piece for Business Insider in support of the Republican candidate, titled "The man who just resigned from Donald Trump's campaign explains how Trump can still win".//Since Mr Trump's election, the president distanced himself from Mr Stone. This, despite Mr Stone regularly appearing on television to defend his former employer. //His Twitter account was temporarily suspended in 2017 after the strategist attacked journalists on the site, allegedly using homophobic language to target CNN presenter Don Lemon.//Mr Stone threatened to sue the platform, saying he had been "inundated on Twitter with bloggers threatening to kill me... yet Twitter seems unconcerned about that".//The political veteran's dress code has also garnered attention. He reportedly does not wear socks, and favours custom-made suits.//"If life is a stage, then you should always be in costume," he told the New York Times in 2015.
