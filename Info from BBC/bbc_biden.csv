"No mandates!" //The administration's workplace vaccine mandate would have required workers to receive a Covid-19 shot, or be masked and tested weekly at their own expense.//It would have applied to workplaces with at least 100 employees and affected some 84 million workers. It was designed to be enforced by employers. //Opponents, including several Republican states and some business groups, said the administration was over-stepping its power with the requirements, which were introduced in November and immediately drew legal challenges.//In the end, Joe Biden's vaccine mandates stood or fell based on judicial interpretations of federal statute, not principles of individual liberty or appeals to the greater good.//According to a majority of the Supreme Court, Mr Biden had the law on his side when ordering healthcare workers to get vaccinated, but using a 51-year-old workplace safety statute to implement a vaccine-or-test requirement on all large employers was a bridge too far.//Once again, the current balance of the Supreme Court comes into sharp relief, with four reliably conservative justices, three reliable liberal ones and two - Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh - at the ideological fulcrum.//This mixed judicial bag is just the latest setback for a presidential Covid-response plan that frequently has seemed a step behind the latest twists in the pandemic. The administration was slow to encourage boosters and caught flat-footed by the Omicron-induced surge in demand for testing.//Now Mr Biden will either have to convince Congress to act on mandates - an unlikely prospect given the brick wall the rest of his agenda keeps hitting in the Senate - or figure out new ways to shepherd the nation out of the pandemic gloom.//In a 6-3 decision, the justices agreed with that argument, saying that the workplace safety rule for large employers was too broad to fall under the authority of the Department of Labor's Occupational Health and Safety Administration to regulate workplace safety.  //"Covid-19 can and does spread at home, in schools, during sporting events, and everywhere else that people gather," the court's majority wrote. //"That kind of universal risk is no different from the day-to-day dangers that all face from crime, air pollution, or any number of communicable diseases."//"This is no 'everyday exercise of federal power,'" they added. "It is instead a significant encroachment on the lives - and health - of a vast number of employees."//The more limited rule concerning more than 10 million staff at healthcare facilities that receive government funding did not pose the same concern, they decided, by 5-4.//That said imposing conditions on recipients of public money fit "neatly" into the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.//The rulings come as some parts of the policies were due to go into effect this week. The court heard arguments in the case on Friday. //The rulings reflected the political make-up of the court, which now has a majority of justices appointed by Republican presidents. //The court's three liberal justices opposed blocking the vaccine mandate, saying such a decision "stymies the federal government's ability to counter the unparalleled threat that Covid-19 poses to our nation's workers."//Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, seen as moderates in the conservative majority, joined the liberals in allowing the healthcare rule to stand. //The decision comes as the US experiences another wave of Covid-19 infections, with the Omicron variant spurring record cases and hospitalisation rates. //The Biden administration had estimated that instituting a vaccine requirement at big employers would save 6,500 lives and prevent 250,000 hospital admissions over six months.//More than 60% of Americans are fully vaccinated already. Independent of the government's regulations, some companies, including Google, Citibank and IBM, have started to move forward with their own requirements.//But the National Federation of Independent Businesses, a lobby group that was one of the lead plaintiffs challenging the government's workplace vaccine rule, had charged that it would burden small-business owners with new compliance costs, make it harder to fill positions and lead to lost profits and lost sales.//"Today's decision is welcome relief for America's small businesses, who are still trying to get their business back on track since the beginning of the pandemic," said Karen Harned, executive director of the group's legal arm.", 11.8%

I'm tired of being quiet," he added, while banging his fist on the lectern.//Mr Biden said the push to pass the legislation was a "battle for the soul of America", adding that the 60-vote rule - known as the filibuster - had rendered the Senate "a shell of its former self".//For much of the Senate's history unlimited debate was allowed, enabling opponents to block legislation. Supporters say it is a check on government power and forces administrations to seek consensus. //During World War One, rules were adopted to allow a two-thirds majority to bring debate to an end, but it was rarely used, and reduced to the 60-vote rule during the 1970s. //Joe Biden is making a renewed push for voting legislation, but the prospects for success haven't changed much since congressional Democrats first advanced the current package of proposals back in January 2019.//They're dim.//The reasons should be familiar to this White House. Either Democrats need to attract Republican support in the Senate, or they must change the rules to allow the slim Democratic majority there to approve the legislation on its own. Neither seems likely, no matter how many speeches Mr Biden gives.//Mr Biden's Georgia trip could simply be an attempt to satisfy restive members of his party's base, who believe the president is not doing enough to promote what they see as the most important issue facing the nation - and their party - today. But the outlook for success there doesn't look great, either.

Political analysts say the party risks losing control of Congress, and voting reform advocates have expressed frustration that the White House has not acted sooner.//Mr Biden said he was "an institutionalist who was honoured to serve in the Senate" for years, but he argued "the threat to our democracy is so grave" that he felt rule changes were necessary.//But in 2019, Mr Biden warned that doing away with the filibuster would be "very dangerous", pointing out that his fellow Democrats have used the rule often to block Republican legislation. Back in 2005, Mr Biden said any attempt to eliminate the filibuster was "an example of the arrogance of power". //Former President Donald Trump called for the filibuster to be scrapped when his fellow Republicans controlled the Senate, but then-Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell refused to go for "the nuclear option" as it is known on Capitol Hill.//Republicans have argued that Mr Biden's voting legislation would impose questionable national standards on local elections.//Speaking after the president's speech, Republican Senator Mike Capo said the two bills were a "partisan, political power grab" and voiced opposition to changing Senate rules.//Jazmin Kay, 24, is a New York Democrat and the president of youth-voting advocacy group 18by.vote.

That power had been used by the Obama administration to delay moves as minor as the relocation of voting sites or as major as state-wide voter identification laws.//Another Democratic goal has been to ensure that the changes to voting procedures enacted during the pandemic, such as an expansion of early voting, the greater use of ballot drop boxes and easier access to absentee and mail-in voting, are kept in place in coming elections.//Democratic-controlled legislatures in some states, such as Virginia, Nevada and Maine, have already taken action. Democrats in Congress, however, are pushing to set federal standards that would apply to every state.//At least for the moment, Republicans are locked out of power at the national level, so their voting efforts have been focused on state legislatures under their party's control. They've passed limitations on mail-in absentee voting and the use of ballot drop boxes, among other steps. //Texas, for instance, passed a provision that bans drive-through voting, 24-hour voting locations and the distribution of unsolicited mail-in ballot applications by public officials - methods used by Democratic-controlled cities during the 2020 presidential election.//In Georgia, the Republican legislature enacted a law that restricts drop boxes - which were approved for widespread use in 2020 by the state's election board to address pandemic concerns - to one per 100,000 voters.//It also restricts their location to only inside election offices or early voting sites and their use only to early voting periods, and limits when a voter can request an absentee ballot to 67 days before election (down from six months).//Republican legislatures have also pushed for expanded use of photo identification during voting and better identity verification during the voter registration process.//Behind these two very different ideas about what constitutes voting reform are two very different ideas about the dangers currently facing the US.  //According to a CBS survey, 60% of Democrats and 74% of Republicans view democracy and the rule of law in the US as "somewhat" or "very" threatened. //But of those numbers, 79% of Republicans thought a major reason for this was "people voting or casting ballots illegally", while only 18% of Democrats agreed. Meanwhile, 89% of Democrats thought "people trying to overturn or change elections" was a major reason, something only half of Republicans believed.//The Republican view that the 2020 election was rife with fraud, even though there has been little concrete evidence to support this, animates their desire to pass new voting restrictions at the state level. //Democratic concerns about those efforts, even if many of them are an attempt to return to pre-pandemic systems that were heavily reliant on in-person voting in most states, have driven their efforts at the national level.//The high-stakes battle over US voting rightsWhy itâs easier to vote in Canada than the US//Democrats have opposed the kind of Republican-backed polling location and procedure changes that previously required federal approval. They argue that such changes are making voting more difficult for traditionally marginalized communities that often vote heavily Democratic.//Shortening early voting periods and hours can make it harder for blue-collar and service-industry workers to vote. They believe robust voting early and via mail can help avoid the long lines at polling places that have been an problem in traditionally Democratic precincts even before the pandemic.//In Georgia, for instance, the state's population has grown by about 2 million people since the 2013 Supreme Court case ending pre-approval of voting changes, but the number of polling locations has decreased by 10% - a trend that is mirrored in many other southern states previously covered by the Voting Rights Act. //Many Republicans, for their part, believe that judges and obscure election boards changed the rules of the game in 2020 under the guise of the pandemic in a way that increased the potential for fraud (and made it easier for Democratic constituencies to vote). //They point to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which allowed absentee ballots to be counted until three days after election day, and North Carolina, where the state board of elections extended the deadline for receiving ballots to nine days after election day.//A concern among Republicans is that Democrats - including those in liberal cities located in conservative states - are now trying to make those changes permanent in order to secure a voting advantage. Much of the Texas law, for instance, can be viewed as a direct response to measures to increase voting access in the Houston area, which has become a Democratic stronghold.//At the state level, the voting-reform die has already been cast. //According to a study by New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, 19 states passed laws restricting voting access in 2021 - more than any year since the centre began its monitoring in 2011. //Meanwhile, 25 states have undertaken steps to expand voting rights, including 15 that have made mail-in voting easier.//Democratic efforts in Congress continue to face the same legislative obstacles that have bedevilled the rest of Mr Biden's domestic agenda - unified Republican opposition coupled with a handful of centrist Senate Democrats who are unwilling to change legislative rules to pave the way for more sweeping reforms.//Mr Biden's renewed interest in the legislation will probably please his party's liberal wing, which views voting reform as essential to preserving American democracy (and protecting Democratic electoral prospects), but there is not much evidence at this point that even the most enthusiastic effort on the part of the president and his administration will produce tangible results.", 8.6%

It says it is entitled to move its troops freely on its own soil.//No time for war: Russians see no chance of conflictIs Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? //Although the two sides exchanged warnings during the call, Russian foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters shortly after that Mr Putin was "pleased" with the conversation. He added that it had created a "good backdrop" for future talks.//A senior US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the tone had been "serious and substantive."//"President Biden reiterated that substantive progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of de-escalation," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said.//"He made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine," she added.//US and Russian officials are set to meet for in-person talks in Geneva next month, and the White House said Mr Biden urged his Russian counterpart to pursue a diplomatic solution.//In a holiday message before Thursday's call, Mr Putin told Mr Biden he was "convinced" the pair could work together based on "mutual respect and consideration of each other's national interests".//His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow was "in the mood for a conversation".//"We believe that only through talks is it possible to solve all the immediate problems that we have in abundance between us," Mr Peskov added.//White House officials sound calm when they talk about Ukraine, at least while speaking outside of the West Wing. //The phone call between President Biden and President Putin on Thursday, as a senior administration official told reporters in the early evening, was "a serious, substantive, conversation".//That official spoke in a measured voice about the talks, and sounded even-tempered when he spoke about the threat from Russia.

"Covid: US halves isolation time for asymptomatic infection", "US health officials have halved the recommended isolation time for people with asymptomatic Covid-19 from 10 to five days, amid a surge in cases.//US health officials have halved the recommended isolation time for people with asymptomatic Covid-19 from 10 to five days, amid a surge in cases.//The measure is expected to alleviate disruption caused by staff shortages in many areas because of infections.//The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says most transmissions happen in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop.//But experts have criticised the lack of testing requirements to end isolation.//The sharp rise in cases has been fuelled by the Omicron variant of the virus, which is now dominant in the US. Early studies suggest Omicron is more contagious than other variants, although milder. //The growing number of people having to isolate has put pressure on several industries, including air travel, with thousands of flights cancelled during the Christmas holiday.//Leaders of major US airlines were among those calling for the change, as cancellations continued for a fourth day on Tuesday. //The CDC said the new guidance was "motivated by science", and that the isolation must be followed by five days of wearing a mask around others. The announcement came as more than 200,000 daily infections were confirmed in the past two days nationwide. //CDC director Dr Rochelle Walensky said the recommendation "balances what we know about the spread of the virus and the protection provided by vaccination and booster doses".//"These updates ensure people can safely continue their daily lives," Dr Walensky said in a statement.//But there was no recommendation for people to take rapid at-home tests before the end of their isolation periods. Many experts say such tests help to show whether people continue to spread the virus.//Dr Michael Mina, an assistant professor at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, called the lack of such requirement "reckless".//"I absolutely don't want to sit next to someone who turned Positive 5 days ago and hasn't tested [negative]," he said on Twitter.//In England, people are now required to isolate for seven days, instead of 10, with two negative lateral flow tests needed to end their self-isolation - the first no earlier than day six of isolation and a second 24 hours later.//Speaking on CNN, the top US infectious disease expert said the CDC decision would allow people to return to work more quickly, calling it "very prudent" and a "good choice".//"With the sheer volume of new cases that we're having and that we expect to continue with Omicron, one of the things we want to be careful of is that we don't have so many people out," Dr Anthony Fauci, who also serves as President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, said.//Infectiousness is not like a switch. It does not just go on to off. Instead, people with Covid gradually go from a period of peak infectiousness to lower infectiousness.//The most infectious period starts a few days before symptoms develop. This is one of the reasons why the virus is so hard to contain. After about five days, the risk of passing on the virus will start to decline for most people.//But it is still possible to pass on the virus. That is why when countries started introducing isolation periods many went for 14 days. It was a belt-and-braces approach. But over time these isolation periods have been reduced, reflecting the reduced threat the virus presents as vaccines have been rolled out.//In England it has now been set at seven days if you are negative using a rapid test. That should give people a good idea if they have passed peak infectiousness and reflects the fact the UK has made these rapid tests easily accessible to everyone.//The US approach for people without symptoms is grounded in research that suggests these cases are likely to be less infectious to start with. At the end of the day, it is all about balancing the risks - from both the virus and our responses to it.//The CDC also shortened the quarantine period for people exposed to someone infected. Unvaccinated people will be required to quarantine for five days after exposure, down from 14.//The same applies to people who were more than six months on from their second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or two months after a Johnson & Johnson dose, and had not yet received a booster shot.//Last week, the CDC reduced the recommended isolation time for asymptomatic health workers from 10 to seven days. But they were required to take a test to end their isolation period.//While the new recommendations are not mandatory, they are closely followed by many businesses and policymakers across the US.//EXPLAINER: Omicron up to 70% less likely to need hospital careIN CHARTS: Tracking the pandemic//On Monday, President Biden pledged to deal with a shortage of tests as Omicron threatens to overwhelm hospitals.//"Seeing how tough it was for some folks to get a test this weekend shows that we have more work to do," he said as he joined a call with the administration's Covid response team and state governors. "It's clearly not enough."//New steps will include improving at-home test manufacturing and making it easier to use Google to locate nearby test centres, he said.//Different states and local authorities in the US are introducing new measures in a bid to combat rising cases.
