"Biden: COVID-19 'Probably Here To Stay' In The World", "Reporter, HuffPost//Reporter, HuffPost//President Joe Biden is telling Americans life with COVID-19 is going to get better but the virus is likely “here to stay,” as the latest variant registers record high infection rates in the United States.//“Having COVID in the environment and in the world is probably here to stay, but COVID as we’re dealing with it now is not here to stay,” Biden said Friday when asked if he thought COVID-19 would be in people’s lives forever. “We are going to be able to control this. The new normal is not going to be what it is now. It’s going to be better.”//The nation is seeing record high cases as the highly contagious omicron strain rips through communities. The United States recorded about 1 million new cases a day this week — more than any other country in the world has reported. Hospitalization rates have also reached new heights, overwhelming medical providers, though death rates have remained stable so far.//This week, former White House advisers wrote a paper urging for a national strategy that acknowledges COVID-19 as part of the “new normal.” Biden seemed to acknowledge that view Friday, saying the virus would continue to exist in the environment, but that the United States would push for measures to contain it.//High case loads paired with persistent testing shortages and legal battles brought on by conservative groups against the administration’s public health measures have put a strain on the White House’s COVID-19 response. The country seemed to be caught off guard by the omicron variant.//Meanwhile, cancellations across industries, from air travel to live entertainment, have stoked fears of another lockdown similar to the start of the pandemic two years ago.//And while the vast majority of schools remain open for in-person learning, staffing shortages and high case loads have forced some school districts and universities to temporarily shut down or go back to virtual learning.//Biden and the White House have actively pushed back against that narrative that the country is reverting back to the early days of the pandemic. //“We have so many more tools we are developing and continue to develop that can contain COVID and other strains of COVID,” Biden said. “If you take a look, we are very different today than we were a year ago even though we still have problems.”//The ways those tools will be implemented, however, is still up in the air.//Reporter, HuffPost//

"The Conservative Supreme Court Justices Aren't Hot On Biden's Vaccine-Or-Test Rule", "Labor Reporter, HuffPost//Labor Reporter, HuffPost//The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Friday to determine the fate of the White House’s federal vaccine rules for workers, pressing the Biden administration and GOP state officials on the question of whether federal agencies can require COVID-19 vaccination or testing in the workplace.//The justices are expected to decide relatively quickly whether to block the Biden administration from imposing the vaccine rules while litigation plays out in lower courts. Rulings against the White House would be a significant setback for the president’s vaccination campaign at a time when COVID-19 caseloads have ballooned due to the omicron variant.//If the justices allow either or both rules to stand, it could nudge more workers into getting vaccinated in order to keep their jobs.//The court holds a 6-3 conservative majority, and has already upheld the ability of states to implement vaccine requirements for workers during the pandemic. But the line of questioning Friday suggested the conservative justices were skeptical of the federal government’s power to impose broad vaccine regulations.//One rule, issued through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, would require employers with at least 100 workers to implement programs in which those workers either show proof of vaccination or undergo weekly testing for the coronavirus. The White House estimates that it would cover 84 million employees at work sites around the country.//The other rule, issued through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, would require workers at health care facilities that receive Medicare or Medicaid funding to be vaccinated. That regulation would impact some 17 million employees at 76,000 workplaces, including hospitals, long-term facilities and dialysis centers, the administration has said.//The two regulations prompted a thicket of lawsuits filed by Republican state officials and business groups who argued the White House overstepped its legal authority. Citing the broad economic effects of such rules, the plaintiffs argued that neither OSHA nor CMS could issue them without an act of Congress.//“This is the policy that’s most geared toward stopping all of this. There’s nothing else that will perform that function better than incentivizing people strongly to vaccinate themselves.”//Scott Keller, who argued against the OSHA rule on behalf of a business lobby, the National Federation of Independent Business, said the regulation would lead to “permanent worker displacement” as workers left jobs due to the vaccine-or-test requirement.//“A single federal agency tasked with occupational standards cannot commandeer businesses economywide into becoming de facto public health agencies,” Keller said.//Justice Elena Kagan was skeptical that OSHA overstepped its bounds. She asked Keller how the COVID-19 pandemic wouldn’t qualify as an emergency worthy of OSHA’s intervention, calling it “by far the greatest public health danger this country has faced in the last century.”//“This is the policy that’s most geared toward stopping all of this,” she said. “There’s nothing else that will perform that function better than incentivizing people strongly to vaccinate themselves. Why isn’t this necessary and grave?”//She acknowledged the rule was “an extraordinary use of emergency power,” but called the pandemic “an extraordinary circumstance.”//Justice Stephen Breyer cited the explosion in COVID-19 case numbers as the omicron variant spreads and asked how it could “conceivably be in the public interest” to block the OSHA rule.//“Are you really asking us to issue a stay?” Breyer asked.//The questioning from Justice Amy Coney Barrett, however, suggested she thought perhaps the OSHA rule was too sweeping in the way it touched all industries, as opposed to being targeted. She noted that “there are some workplaces in which the danger to employees is different,” citing the example of meatpacking plants, which have hosted some of the country’s worst outbreaks.//Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued in favor of the OSHA rule for the federal government, said the vaccine-or-test mandate was in “the heartland of OSHA’s regulatory authority.”//Chief Justice John Roberts noted that the Biden administration has issued a handful of vaccine rules through different agencies, including one for federal contractors, and asked “why Congress doesn’t have a say in this.”//“It seems to me that the government is trying to work across the waterfront and it’s just going agency by agency,” he said.//Justice Samuel Alito seemed to agree with opponents of the OSHA rule by saying it was “fundamentally different” from other occupational health rules. He wondered if OSHA was trying to “squeeze an elephant through a mouse hole” by implementing the rule.//“This affects employees all the time,” Alito said. “If you’re vaccinated when you’re on the job, you’re vaccinated when you’re not on the job.”//Brian Fletcher, the principal deputy solicitor general who argued in favor of the CMS rule, said its purpose was to protect patients by assuring caregivers are vaccinated. He argued that CMS has clear authority to require vaccinations at facilities that accept Medicare and Medicaid dollars.//“It seems to me that the government is trying to work across the waterfront and it’s just going agency by agency.”//Roberts seemed to suggest in his questioning that he felt the administration’s case might be stronger for the CMS rule, since the agency’s primary mission is health care.//Kagan noted that the CMS rule amounted to a “spending clause case,” since the agency’s power to implement a vaccine rule rests on the fact that the health care facilities take government funding. “The government has more power to decide where it wants to spend its money,” she said.//But Justice Neil Gorsuch suggested the government would be using its funding power in a punitive way to control employment practices. When giving CMS its funding powers, he said, Congress would have assumed “you cannot use the money as a weapon to control these things.”//The lower courts have been split on the question of whether the White House was on sound legal footing in trying to implement the rules. The OSHA regulation was temporarily blocked in November by a panel of three appellate judges, two of whom were appointees of former President Donald Trump. But after several lawsuits were consolidated, another panel of judges lifted that stay after finding OSHA had the authority to enact its emergency rule.//The CMS rule was blocked in roughly half of states but allowed to proceed in the other half, where it is already in effect. OSHA is slated to begin enforcement of certain parts of its rule on Jan. 10. The justices may choose to act as quickly as possible to give employers some clarity.//Alito floated the idea of the court entering a brief administrative stay against the OSHA rule to buy more time to evaluate the case.//However the justices rule on the cases, the Supreme Court as an institution seems to believe COVID-19 safety rules are critical for the workplace. In order to enter the court, lawyers had to test negative for COVID-19 regardless of whether they’re vaccinated. In that sense, the Supreme Court’s own rule is more stringent than OSHA’s, which would not require regular testing for vaccinated workers.//Labor Reporter, HuffPost//

"Biden To Deliver His First State Of The Union Address On March 1", "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden will deliver his first State of the Union address on March 1, the White House confirmed Friday, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent the president a formal invitation to speak to Congress and the American public one year into his term.//WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden will deliver his first State of the Union address on March 1, the White House confirmed Friday, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent the president a formal invitation to speak to Congress and the American public one year into his term.//It will mark the latest any president has delivered a State of the Union address. The speech is normally timed for January, and occasionally for February. The delay is driven in part by a busy legislative calendar, a winter spike in COVID-19 cases from the more transmissible omicron variant and the upcoming Winter Olympics, which ties up broadcast network time.//The last State of the Union address was delivered by then-President Donald Trump on the eve of his acquittal by the Senate in his first impeachment trial.//Biden first addressed a joint session of Congress in April 2021, about 100 days into his time in the White House, which he used to promote twin infrastructure and domestic spending bills. Biden signed a slimmed-down and bipartisan version of the infrastructure proposal into law last year in crowning first-year legislative achievements. The larger expansion of the social safety net passed the House, but Biden has struggled to secure enough Democratic support in the Senate for passage.//An address to Congress in the president’s first year is not an official State of the Union address, and Biden’s April speech bore little resemblance to one because of strict COVID-19 protocols. It was marked by limitations on attendance, with no guests allowed, and lawmakers seated on both the floor of the House chamber and the galleries above. Officials said pandemic precautions for this year’s speech were still being worked out, though they expect it to look more like a traditional State of the Union address than last year’s remarks.//“Thank you for your bold vision and patriotic leadership which have guided America out of crisis and into an era of great progress, as we not only recover from the pandemic but Build Back Better!,” Pelosi wrote in her letter to Biden. “In that spirit, I am writing to invite you to address a Joint Session of Congress on Tuesday, March 1, to share your vision of the State of the Union.”//

"Mary Trump Spots The ‘Psy-Op’ Against Donald Trump In Joe Biden’s Jan. 6 Speech", "Reporter, HuffPost//Reporter, HuffPost//Mary Trump thinks one element of President Joe Biden’s speech on Thursday marking the anniversary of the U.S. Capitol riot was aimed at getting right under the skin of her uncle, former President Donald Trump.//Trump and MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell noted on Thursday that Biden used the word “lost” multiple times in his address.//“It made me think of the way the intelligence community briefs the president before talking to people like (Russian President) Vladimir Putin about what might irritate them … what might make them feel uncomfortable,” said O’Donnell.//“This seemed to have some passages in there that were absolutely true and important for America to hear, but the White House and the president had to know would go straight into Donald Trump’s heart,” he suggested.//Trump, a fierce critic of her uncle, agreed.//“I thought it was masterfully done and exactly, as you say, along the lines of a psy-op, if you will,” she said.//“It was designed, at least in those parts, to make it clear to everybody listening to that speech what the reality of the 2020 election was ― that Donald lost badly and Joe Biden is the legitimate president ― but also to make it clear to Donald that nobody is fooled by his lies, except maybe himself,” Trump added.//Watch the interview here://Reporter, HuffPost//

Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of former President Donald Trump’s closest allies in Congress, on Sunday rejected a request for an interview by the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection.//In a combative letter to committee chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Jordan said, “The American people are tired of Democrats’ nonstop investigations and partisan witch hunts.”//He said the interview request “amounts to an unprecedented and inappropriate demand to examine the basis for a colleague’s decision on a particular matter pending before the House of Representatives.”//“This request is far outside the bounds of any legitimate inquiry, violates core constitutional principles and would serve to further erode legislative norms,” he added.//Thompson told Jordan in a letter last month that the panel wants him to provide information surrounding his communications with Trump on Jan. 6 and Trump’s efforts to challenge the result of the 2020 election.//“We understand that you had at least one and possibly multiple communications with President Trump on January 6th,” the letter read. “We would like to discuss each such communication with you in detail.”//In his response Sunday, Jordan insisted, “I have no relevant information that would assist the Select Committee in advancing any legitimate legislative purpose.”//He accused Democrats of using the committee as “a partisan cudgel against their political adversaries.”//Jordan is a staunch supporter of Trump’s false claims about voter fraud. The lawmaker brought those claims up during an October hearing on a motion to hold former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in contempt for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena.//In that hearing, Jordan admitted that he spoke with Trump on the day of the attack.//“Of course, I talked to the president,” Jordan told members of the Rules Committee, in response to questioning from the panel’s chairman, Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass. “I talked to him that day. I’ve been clear about that. I don’t recall the number of times, but it’s not about me. I know you want to make it about that.”//The panel is also seeking information regarding Jordan’s meeting with Trump and members of his administration in November and December 2020, and in early January 2021, “about strategies for overturning the results of the 2020 election.” Thompson’s letter said the committee is also interested in any discussions Jordan may have had during that time regarding the possibility of presidential pardons for people involved in any aspect of the Capitol attack or the planning for the two rallies that took place that day.//

"Donald Trump Reportedly Dialed Sean Hannity Into Oval Office Meetings", "Trends Reporter, HuffPost//Trends Reporter, HuffPost//Former President Donald Trump and his Fox News influencers were so joined at the hip that he even dialed Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs into Oval Office meetings, according to an unidentified former senior administration official, The Washington Post reported Sunday.//A “lot of it” concerned public relations — “what he should be saying and how he should be saying it; he should be going harder against wearing masks or whatever,” Trump’s former press secretary Stephanie Grisham told the Post, apparently confirming the information.//According to Grisham, Trump frequently consulted with Hannity and Fox News host Jeanine Pirro.//“There were times the president would come down [in the] morning and say, ‘Well, Sean thinks we should do this,’ or, ‘Judge Jeanine thinks we should do this,’” said Grisham. She described Hannity on CNN last Thursday as Trump’s “shadow adviser,” who counseled him on “many, many things.”//Jeff Cohen, author of “Cable News Confidential,” slammed the relationship as a violation of public trust by Fox hosts because viewers have no idea how close they are to Trump and are under the impression there is some objectivity to their on-air reports. //The startlingly close relationship between a sitting president and what the Post called a “Cable Cabinet” of members of a right-wing news operation was underscored by the multiple texts released last month by the House select committee investigating the Jan, 6 insurrection.//As last year’s Jan. 6 violence unfolded in the U.S. Capitol, Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham, Brian Kilmeade and Hannity all texted then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, pleading with him to press Trump to intervene to stop the siege. They all later downplayed the insurrection on Fox News, or even blamed the attack on the building on Antifa or members of the Black Lives Matter.//It was one of the few times Trump wasn’t listening to his Fox News brain trust. It took him more than three hours on Jan. 6 to speak out against the violence.//“He can’t mention the election again. Ever,” Hannity texted Meadows days after the insurrection. “I did not have a good call with him today.”//But Trump enthusiastically embraced just about every other “fantastical” Fox favorite, including support for now-disgraced attorney Sidney Powell, who repeatedly pitched wildly baseless claims of election fraud, informal Trump adviser Michael Pillsbury told the Post.//Trump’s Fox pals could suddenly “completely change his mind on something,” said his former communications director Alyssa Farah Griffin, and the staff would have to scramble to do damage control.//Hannity wielded clout even during Trump’s 2016 campaign, calling Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel to complain about strategy, according to the Post.//The first time then-Speaker of the House Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) met the president-elect at Trump Tower in December 2016, Hannity called mid-meeting, reported Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa in their book “Peril.” //Trump “answered the call as Ryan and his advisers sat silent. ‘Yeah, I’m here with Paul,’ Trump told Hannity. ’Oh?

Trump’s refusal to accept the reality of his defeat spawned a conspiracy that came close to shattering the nation’s system of government and continues to ripple through society a year later.//“I did not seek this fight, brought to this Capitol one year ago today, but I will not shrink from it either,” Biden said in his 25-minute address from Statuary Hall, where rioters had roamed one year earlier. “I will stand in this breach. I will defend this nation. And I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of democracy.”//Yet even in his own telling, Biden’s presidency has been shaped by and in response to his predecessor.//At age 75 and grieving the recent death of his adult son, the former vice president decided to reenter public life to battle for the “soul of America” after watching Trump deliver praise for some of the white supremacists at a violent protest in Charlottesville in 2017. Biden vanquished fresher and more popular faces in a contentious 2020 Democratic primary on the promise that he was the most capable of unseating Trump. And he was sworn into the office just two weeks after the violent insurrection because he convinced Americans that he could turn the page on a turbulent four years.//Biden didn’t mention the former president by name even once in Thursday’s remarks. But he fired off zingers and reprimands aimed directly at Trump and the party that has increasingly cast itself in his image.//Trump, said Biden, is not just a former president, but a defeated one whose “bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy.”//He refuted Trump’s “big lie” — three of them, actually — and efforts to continue to sow doubt about the conduct of an election that even the former president’s own attorney general and judicial picks determined to be fair and free of significant misconduct.//He mocked the self-described patriotism of those who attacked law enforcement and breached the Capitol, as well as that of the man who inspired them to do it. “You can’t love your country only when you win,” Biden said.//The anniversary marked Biden’s most forceful condemnation of his predecessor, after a maiden year in office spent trying, often unsuccessfully, to avoid talking about “the former guy.”//“I’m tired of talking about Donald Trump,” he said four weeks into his presidency. “I don’t want to talk about him anymore.”//But in the past year, Trump has gone from twice-impeached pariah to self-styled president-in-exile, his grip on the GOP stronger now than when he left office. Trump has mounted an aggressive campaign to oust from his party the few Republicans willing to condemn him. And he has amassed a war chest with the aim of retaking the White House in 2024.//It is a paradox for the president: Biden is often at his best when he takes on Trump, yet talking about the former president also serves to elevate him in the national conversation.//There could well be a rematch in 2024. Biden, who has said he intends to seek another term, told ABC last month that he’s even more likely to run again if Trump is on the GOP ticket.//But there’s a simultaneous effort afoot to change how elections are run, and that could portend a very different dynamic in a contested election next time.//Republicans in numerous states are promoting efforts to influence future elections by installing sympathetic leaders in local election posts and they’re backing for elective office some of those who participated in the insurrection. Democrats, for their part, are pushing voting changes that would seek to undo those GOP efforts and enshrine in law other longtime Democratic priorities.//The violence on Jan. 6 was only a small piece of the overall effort by pro-Trump allies to subvert the election. More than 50 lawsuits were filed in battleground states alleging some type of election fraud, a push that failed after judges named to the bench by many different presidents — including Trump himself -— rejected the claims. The Justice Department launched an effort to investigate instances of widespread voter fraud, only to have former Attorney General William Barr tell The Associated Press there was none. And Trump allies made unfounded accusations about voting machines used in many states, including false claims that some were made by a company with ties to Venezuela, among other wild allegations now the subject of defamation litigation.//Despite his insistent speech Thursday, Biden and other administration officials do not generally publicly dwell on the conspiracy theories around the election, in part because it gives fuel to the fire. And it’s widely expected that, despite Biden’s pledge to help push voting rights legislation to completion, he’s not going to look back at the events of 2020 much more. His belief is that he’s more likely to win over Trump supporters by governing, and doing it well, than by constantly re-litigating his presidential win.//As he left the Capitol on Thursday, Biden stopped to explain why he had decided to so forcefully criticize Trump after shying away from it for so long. “The way you have to heal is you have to recognize the extent of the wound.”//“You’ve got to face it,” he added. “That’s what great nations do. They face the truth. Deal with it. And move on.”//Much as Biden would like to move on, though, the future of America’s democracy is now tethered to the events of the 2020 election and the ongoing fallout that show no signs of disappearing.//___//EDITOR’S NOTE — Zeke Miller has covered the White House for the AP since 2017.

"Supreme Court To Decide Fate Of Biden’s Vaccine Rules", "Labor Reporter, HuffPost//Labor Reporter, HuffPost//In early November, President Biden issued two sweeping federal rules aimed at getting as many workers as possible vaccinated against COVID-19. Whether those controversial rules survive is now in the hands of the Supreme Court. //The justices are scheduled to hear oral arguments Friday in a pair of cases revolving around the emergency regulations. Republican leaders and business groups sued to stop the rules from going into effect, leading to injunctions and differing opinions in the lower courts. After groups filed emergency requests with the Supreme Court, the justices decided to expedite both of the hot-button cases and hear them together this week.//The special session is meant to determine whether the Biden administration can enforce the vaccine rules while that litigation plays out, but the underlying question is whether or not the White House has the legal authority to issue the rules in the first place. //An estimated 86% of U.S. adults have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to The New York Times. But the administration says that rate needs to be higher, especially amid a surge in cases due to the omicron variant, and the vaccine rules are central to the White House effort to get remaining holdouts inoculated.//Both of the administration’s rules are employer mandates, but only one is a true vaccine mandate.//That rule, issued through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, requires that workers in health care facilities that receive Medicare or Medicaid funding get vaccinated. If workers don’t get the jab, then their federally funded employers can’t let them work. The White House estimates the rule would cover 17 million workers at 76,000 sites, including hospitals, long-term care facilities and dialysis centers, among others.//In explaining the rule, the administration said it would bring peace of mind to patients wondering about their caregivers’ vaccination status, reduce staff sickness and quarantines and “create a level playing field across health care facilities.”//The other vaccine regulation is less stringent but far more expansive. The rule administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration would require employers with at least 100 workers to create programs in which workers either show proof of vaccination or undergo weekly testing for COVID-19. The employers would also have to offer workers paid time off to get their shots, and make sure that unvaccinated workers wear a mask in the workplace.//“The White House estimates the OSHA rule would cover 84 million workers.”//The OSHA rule is really a vax-or-test mandate; technically no one would be obligated to get a shot because of it. Still, the hassles of weekly testing might make vaccination more appealing, and that’s almost certainly part of the idea. At-home COVID-19 tests would be accepted so long as they’re done at the worksite or proctored online, but such tests can be hard to find right now. Employers aren’t obligated to foot the bill for testing under the rule. //The White House estimates the OSHA rule would cover 84 million workers, most of them in the private sector, but many in the public sector as well, including the U.S. Postal Service. Employers who failed to follow it would be subject to fines — up to around $13,700 in most cases — but the agency said it expects the vast majority of firms to comply with it willingly. Indeed, many large employers have already instituted mandates on their own.//OSHA has estimated that the rule would save 6,500 lives and prevent 250,000 hospitalizations over a span of six months. //Republicans in Congress are so opposed to the OSHA rule that they briefly considered using a government shutdown as leverage to kill it.//The Supreme Court, which currently holds a 6-3 conservative majority, has already declined to knock down state vaccine mandates for workers instituted during the pandemic. But the cases involving Biden’s vaccine rules hinge on a different issue: whether the relevant federal agencies have the statutory power to implement them.//A slew of business groups and states, the vast majority GOP-led, have sued to stop both rules on the grounds that they exceed the legal authority of OSHA and CMS. The OSHA rule was blocked temporarily by one appeals court, then later reinstated by another. The CMS rule was blocked in roughly half the states but allowed to move forward in the other half.//One of the loudest opponents of the OSHA rule is the conservative Liberty Justice Center, which says it aims to “protect workers’ rights and free speech” and “combat cancel culture and government overreach.” The group and other critics of the rule argue in part that COVID-19 is far more than a workplace hazard, and a mandate to vaccinate or test would require an act of Congress. //The group succeeded in getting a stay against the rule in November when a panel for the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that there was “cause to believe there are grave statutory and constitutional issues with the Mandate.” Two of the three judges were appointed by former President Donald Trump.//However, that stay was lifted by another panel at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which found that the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 gave OSHA the authority to protect against infectious disease, regardless of whether it’s a hazard beyond the workplace. //They wrote that OSHA’s authority “is hardly limited to ‘hard hats and safety goggles.’ OSHA has wide discretion to form and implement the best possible solution to ensure the health and safety of all workers, and has historically exercised that discretion.”//The arguments against the CMS rule track along similar lines. Opponents claim that given the economic and political significance of the regulation, CMS would need express permission from Congress to issue it. A federal judge in Missouri — also a Trump appointee — agreed, saying the agency exceeded its authority and that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their argument that the rule is “arbitrary and capricious.”//“The litigation surrounding both rules hasn’t left employers with much clarity on what to expect.”//The Biden administration says the CMS rule is meant to protect patients, and argues that the agency has clear authority to do so at facilities that accept Medicare and Medicaid dollars. Xavier Becerra, head of the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes CMS, estimated that the rule would save “several hundred ... or perhaps several thousand” lives each month.//The litigation surrounding both rules hasn’t left employers with much clarity on what to expect.//OSHA said it will not issue citations for any part of the rule before Jan. 10, and won’t enforce the weekly testing requirement until Feb. 9. And while CMS is already enforcing its rule in the states where it can, the agency is giving health care facilities a runway of several weeks to reach 100% vaccination rates before they can be fined or lose federal funding. //The Supreme Court is expected to rule quickly on the cases, and their decisions could change those timelines further, or render them moot.//Labor Reporter, HuffPost//

"Biden Blasts ‘Shadow Of Lies’ That Led To Jan. 6 Riot At U.S. Capitol", "Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost//Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost//President Joe Biden, in a speech marking the anniversary of the 2021 U.S. Capitol riot, blasted the “shadow of lies” that led to a failed insurrection meant to nullify his election victory over Donald Trump, and condemned Republicans who continue to indulge Trump’s falsehoods.//Biden’s speech, delivered from Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol, amounted to a count-by-count debunking of Trump’s lies about supposed widespread election fraud and what happened on Jan. 6. He noted that election officials across the country, as well as Trump’s own attorney general, agreed Biden had won one of the most scrutinized elections in history. //“You can’t love your country only when you win,” Biden said. “You can’t obey the law only when it is convenient. You can’t be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.”//Biden did not use the event to push the Democratic Party’s sweeping voting rights legislation ― he plans to travel to Georgia to deliver a speech on the proposed law next week.//“At this moment we must decide what kind of nation we are going to be,” Biden said in Thursday’s remarks. “Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm? Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people? Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?”//“We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation,” he concluded. //Biden returned to one of the signature themes of his presidency, framing the fight over Trump’s lies as part of a struggle against authoritarianism around the world.//“We’re engaged in a new struggle between democracy and autocracy, between the aspirations of the many and the greed of the few, between people’s right of self-determination and self-serving autocrats,” he said. “In China, Russia and beyond, they’re betting democracy’s days are numbered.”//Biden never mentioned Trump by name, instead referring to him as a “defeated former president.” He told reporters after the speech that he’d avoided using Trump’s name because he “did not want to turn it into a contemporary political battle.”//But the political battle came regardless. Trump released a statement claiming Biden was aiming “to further divide America.”//Trump had announced his own plan to hold a press conference on Thursday, but he canceled that event after realizing it was unlikely to draw extensive television coverage.//Biden’s speech is one of several planned events at the Capitol to commemorate the day of the attack and the ultimate certification of the Electoral College vote. Included on the schedule are a prayer vigil, a discussion with historians and a moment of silence. Across the country, right-wing groups are holding their own vigils intended to celebrate the rioters ― though mainstream congressional Republicans are largely avoiding those events.//Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost//

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) on Wednesday recalled the “dramatic moment” Democratic and GOP senators came together to applaud incoming President Joe Biden’s televised call on Jan. 6, 2021, for then-President Donald Trump to “demand an end to this siege.” //Klobuchar, talking with “The Late Show” host Stephen Colbert on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the U.S. Capitol riot, remembered lawmakers from both parties being taken to a secure room as Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to stop then-Vice President Mike Pence from certifying the 2020 election result.//Colbert asked if Democrats were “thrown in there together” with Republicans, such as Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas), Josh Hawley (Mo.) and Lindsey Graham (S.C.) — who had promoted Trump’s election lies.//“Everyone was in the same room. We got TVs on so you could see what was happening,” Klobuchar said.//“You can see the attack continuing, standing next to the people who invited it?” asked a stunned Colbert.//“That’s correct,” Klobuchar replied.//“I remember there was one dramatic moment,” the senator continued. “Remember how the former president would not even address … it took hours and hours ... But incoming president Biden, he did. And there was a moment where everyone watched him speak and everyone applauded and that was a big deal.”//“Both sides of the aisle applauded?” asked Colbert.//“They did,” said Klobuchar.//Biden, in his address, called on Trump to go on national TV and “demand an end to this siege.” Trump, however, tweeted a video telling rioting supporters were “very special” and asked them to “go home in peace.”//Watch the interview here://Reporter, HuffPost//

Is it really? It’s the MSNBC administration,” she declared.//Ingraham: This isn’t the Biden Administration. It’s the MSNBC Administration pic.twitter.com/DoRqo8nkrn//Critics thought Ingraham’s claim was especially rich, given her TV network’s close ties to Donald Trump’s White House.//Only last month, it emerged Ingraham and fellow prime-timer Sean Hannity texted with then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows during the U.S. Capitol insurrection, urging him to get Trump to call off his rioting supporters.//Fox personalities defended Trump’s outrageous actions on the air throughout his presidency, with Hannity even joining the one-term leader on stage at a rally. Multiple Trump allies have since taken jobs with the network, among them former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany.//Sounds like someone’s worried about the 1/6 commission having their texts. Nothing like projection.//The projection is tremendous in that woman.//Projection much? 🙄//I had this wild dream where Sean Hannity had his texts publicly revealed showing how Fox News was directly advising a past administration.//They need a new game plan instead of constant projection.//Once again, I have nothing left to describe the sheer magnitude of Fox projection.//LOL.

"Unions Take Biden To Court Over COVID Protections For Health Care Workers", "Labor Reporter, HuffPost//Labor Reporter, HuffPost//A group of labor unions representing nurses asked a federal court on Wednesday to force the Biden administration to adopt a COVID-19 safety standard for health care workers, escalating a rare public fight between the White House and labor allies.//The Occupational Safety and Health Administration implemented an emergency safety standard last June to protect nurses and other frontline health care workers during the pandemic. But the Biden administration announced last week that it was withdrawing key portions of that temporary rule while it continued its work developing a permanent one.//The decision to drop existing standards without the new ones in place angered labor groups and workplace safety advocates amid a surge in COVID-19 caseloads due to the omicron variant. The unions that took the Biden administration to court Wednesday said OSHA’s failure to implement a permanent safety standard amounts to “an extremely dangerous breach of its duties.”//“OSHA is charged with ensuring that employers create and maintain safe workplaces, and this delay in issuing a permanent standard puts the lives of nurses and other health care workers, patients, and our communities, in jeopardy,” said Bonnie Castillo, president of National Nurses United, one of the unions involved in the effort.//The legal effort is backed by other major unions that supported Biden’s presidential campaign, such as the American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, as well as the AFL-CIO labor federation.//“OSHA has decided to create a gaping hole in the protection of workers required by Congress.”//Liz Shuler, the federation’s president, said the groups had “no choice but to turn to the courts to ensure that our health care workers are protected.”//OSHA’s emergency standard required hospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities to develop and implement measures to slow the spread of COVID-19. It also mandated that they provide workers with sufficient protective equipment like N95 respirators, maintain social-distancing protocols and screen patients before they enter the workplace. Employers were required to follow the rules under threat of fine.//On Dec. 27, OSHA said it would be withdrawing all parts of the rule that aren’t related to an employer’s obligation to keep safety records. The agency said that under its interpretation of the law, OSHA only had six months to keep the emergency standard in place while it put together a permanent one. And six months was not enough time to get a permanent regulation through the rulemaking process. //But Jordan Barab, a former deputy assistant secretary at OSHA during the Obama years, argued on his blog Confined Space that the law is not so clear, and six months amounted to “an impossible deadline” to develop a permanent rule. He said the administration should have kept the temporary rules in place for the time being, even if it prompted a legal challenge. //“This decision to pull the rug out from underneath the nation’s millions of nurses, doctors and other healthcare workers on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 could not have come at a worse time,” he wrote.//When OSHA issued the emergency rule in June, the agency projected it would cover 18 million workers, preventing 295,284 infections and 776 deaths among health care workers over a six-month period. The labor groups that went to court Wednesday noted that COVID-19 still poses a grave danger, and argued that OSHA is obligated to have a standard in place due to its earlier findings.//“Instead, OSHA has decided to create a gaping hole in the protection of workers required by Congress,” they wrote in their filing. //Even though it was dropping most of the emergency standard, OSHA said it would “vigorously enforce” safety rules at health care facilities through what’s known as the “general duty” clause, which states that employers have a general obligation to keep workers safe from harm. But it can be much more difficult for OSHA to issue citations and fines that stick using the general duty clause as opposed to more specific rules.//The fight over the emergency standard for health care comes at a time when the Biden administration is hoping to salvage its vaccination rules  amid legal battles.//The White House has issued a rule through OSHA that would require large employers across the country to implement programs in which workers either get vaccinated or undergo weekly testing for COVID-19. It issued another rule through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that would require vaccination for workers at health care facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funding.//Both rules have been challenged in court, and the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear appeals in the cases on Friday. //Labor Reporter, HuffPost//

"A Year Later, GOP Lawmakers Still Won't Say If Joe Biden Is Actually President", "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost//Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost//It’s been a year since 147 Republican lawmakers voted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election after fueling a lie about widespread voter fraud.//They cast their votes just hours after a mob of white supremacist supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol with plans to kill House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Vice President Mike Pence and others to stop them from certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s win. They believed the lie, and Trump himself egged them on. Hundreds of lawmakers, staff, reporters and other workers hid for their lives. Five people died and hundreds were injured. Four police officers who defended the Capitol that day later died by suicide.//Biden overwhelmingly won the election. There was never evidence of widespread voter fraud.//Do those 147 Republicans now concede that Biden was elected president, fair and square, a full year later? Do they regret their votes against certifying the Electoral College count? HuffPost posed both questions to all 147 Republicans over the span of a couple of weeks in December, either in person or via their offices. (One of those members, former Rep. Ron Wright of Texas, passed away in February.)//They overwhelmingly declined to answer.//“Call our press office,” said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) when asked if he believes Biden fairly won the election a year ago.//Cruz stood in a Senate elevator as he spoke, and the doors weren’t closing for some reason. HuffPost pressed him on why he wouldn’t answer the question himself since it was about his own belief. For the next seven seconds, Cruz stared blankly in silence until the doors finally closed.//“Cold,” muttered a Capitol Hill photographer standing nearby.//HuffPost went ahead and followed up with Cruz’s press office. “Thanks, Jen, we’ll check on this,” his spokesperson Maria Jeffrey emailed back. They never responded after that.//“Who are you with?” said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) when asked if he regretted his Jan. 6 vote. When HuffPost identified itself, Kennedy walked away.//“Yeah, I don’t have anything for you on that,” he said. “I have people waiting on me.”//HuffPost asked Kennedy again a couple of weeks later, in the event he actually had people waiting on him that first time.//“I don’t have anything for you,” he said again, walking away.//Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) laughed as HuffPost began asking about her vote against certifying Biden’s election.//“I don’t do hallway interviews,” she said, stepping into a Senate elevator.//Asked if she does elevator interviews, Hyde-Smith chuckled again as the doors closed. “I don’t do them in the elevator, either.”//Some GOP senators seemed annoyed at having to answer the question at all.//“He’s the constitutionally elected president,” said Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who voted against certifying Biden’s election. “I’ve said it like a zillion times.”//Asked if he regretted his vote, Scott simply said, “No.”//Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) both firmly said “yes” when asked if they believe Biden won the election fairly. And both just as firmly said “no” about regretting their Jan. 6 votes against certifying the Electoral College results.//Aides to Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) ― the remaining two GOP senators who voted against certifying Biden’s election ― did not respond to emailed requests for comment on both questions.//Of the 139 House Republicans who voted to overturn the election, an aide to just one of them ― one! ― responded to HuffPost’s questions.//“Congressman Sessions stands firm in his decision to vote against certifying the election results of Arizona and Pennsylvania for the purpose of further review,” said Nicole Myers, a spokesperson for Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas).//“There were abnormalities and inconsistencies that Americans were and are still very concerned about,” said Myers, even though there has never been any evidence of widespread voting fraud in Arizona or in Pennsylvania. “Congressman Sessions’ vote was never intended to overturn the election rather to send back the results to the states for a deeper investigation so that Americans could have peace of mind and confidence in the election system.”//An aide to Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) also replied to HuffPost’s email but apparently only to complain about not being asked about something else.//“Reaching back out with one question: Is this the first time you’ve written to me this year?” wrote Issa spokesperson Jonathan Wilcox.//When HuffPost said yes, it appeared to be, Wilcox responded, “That’s what I thought, too.” He never followed up with an answer to either question.//For the moment, Rep. Tom Rice (S.C.) appears to be the only House Republican who publicly regrets his vote against certifying Biden’s win.//He told Politico last month that he should have voted to certify “because President Trump was responsible for the attack on the Capitol.”//“In the wee hours of that disgraceful night, while waiting for the Capitol of our great country to be secured, I knew I should vote to certify,” Rice said. “But because I had made a public announcement of my intent to object, I did not want to go back on my word. So, yeah, I regret my vote to object.”//Alex Enlow, a spokesperson for Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.), made a point to highlight that her boss did vote to certify the votes for Biden as president. Enlow used to work for Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.), who voted not to certify Biden’s win, and HuffPost initially reached out to her for comment about Steube. Enlow responded with an update on her job change ― and a statement from Scott.//“Congress does not have the Constitutional authority to overturn a state’s electoral votes,” Scott said, “so I upheld my oath to the Constitution and voted to certify the election.”//Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost//

But we’re making improvements. In the past two weeks, we’ve stood up federal testing sites all over the country. We’re adding more each and every day,” he added, though he didn’t specify how many.//Pres.

Highly sought-after at-home rapid tests have become scarce in drugstores, even with retailers rationing how many people may purchase. //Biden said testing at home should soon become easier, too. Starting next week, insurance companies will be required to reimburse tests people buy, and the federal government is launching a website this month for people to request free tests. //Last week, the Defense Department announced a $137 million contract to increase production of a key component of rapid COVID-19 tests.//But for many, the tests can’t come fast enough. Though the vaccines appear to be highly effective at minimizing symptoms of COVID-19 in people who have had their full dosage, cases are still soaring, putting immunocompromised people at serious risk and overwhelming hospitals. On Monday, the U.S. reported a million new cases, shattering previous records. //Hospitalization numbers are high, too.

(AP) — After tough talk between Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin over the Russian troop buildup on the Ukraine border, both sides insist they are hopeful that a pathway to easing tensions could open during diplomatic talks set for January.//But with less than two weeks to go before senior U.S. and Russian officials are to meet in Geneva, the chasm is deep and the prospect of finding an exit to the crisis faces no shortage of complications.//Biden on Friday told reporters that he advised Putin when they spoke by phone a day earlier that the upcoming talks could only work if the Russian leader “deescalated, not escalated, the situation” in the days ahead. The U.S. president said he also sought to make plain to Putin that the U.S. and allies stood ready to hit Russia with punishing sanctions if the Russians further invade Ukraine.//“I made it clear to President Putin that if he makes any more moves into Ukraine we will have severe sanctions,” Biden said. “We will increase our presence in Europe with NATO allies.”//Meanwhile, Biden’s national security team on Friday turned their attention to preparation for the Geneva talks, set for Jan. 9 and 10, to discuss the Russian massing of some 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine.//The Geneva talks, which are to be led on the U.S. side by senior State Department officials, are slated to be followed by Russia-NATO council talks and a meeting of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.//Biden is scheduled to speak by phone Sunday with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The two leaders plan to review preparations for the upcoming diplomatic engagements, according to the White House.//Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday debriefed Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on the Biden-Putin call and discussed preparations for the upcoming summit.//“The two weeks ahead are going to be tough,” said Daniel Fried, a former U.S. ambassador to Poland who was a top adviser on Eastern Europe to Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. “The Biden administration has done a pretty credible job of outlining, framing up the negotiations. But the toughest test is yet to come because Putin will continue to engage in threats and brinksmanship to see how determined we are.”//While Biden reiterated that he stood ready to exact sanctions that would reverberate throughout Russia, Kremlin officials doubled down on its warning to Biden about making a “colossal mistake” that could have enormous ramifications for an already fraught U.S.-Russian relationship.//A top Putin aide on Friday reinforced that Russia stands by its demands for written security guarantees. Moscow wants it codified that any future expansion of NATO must exclude Ukraine and other former Soviet bloc countries and demands that the bloc remove offensive weaponry from countries in the Russian neighborhood.//“We will not allow our initiatives to be drowned in endless discussions,” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the state RIA-Novosti news agency Friday. “If no constructive answer comes in a reasonable time and the West continues its aggressive course, Russia will have to take all necessary measures to maintain a strategic balance and remove unacceptable threats to our security.”//The Biden administration and NATO allies have made clear that the Russian demands are non-starters.//The seemingly unrealistic rhetoric has made some in Washington question of how effective talks can be.//Following the Biden-Putin call, a group of 24 former U.S. national security officials and Russia experts- — a group that includes several officials who served in the Obama, George W. Bush and Clinton’s administrations — released a statement calling on Biden to immediately, and publicly, lay out the penalties Russia would face if Putin were to move forward with military action.//The signatories of the statement included several former U.S. ambassadors, including Fried, Russia envoys Michael McFaul and Alexander Vershbow, and Ukraine envoys Steven Pifer and John Herbst.//“We believe the United States should, in closest consultation with its NATO allies and with Ukraine, take immediate steps to affect the Kremlin’s cost-benefit calculations before the Russian leadership opts for further military escalation,” the group wrote. “Such a response would include a package of major and painful sanctions that would be applied immediately if Russia assaults Ukraine. Ideally, the outline of these sanctions would be communicated now to Moscow, so that the Kremlin has a clear understanding of the magnitude of the economic hit it will face.”//The Russians for their part continue to make the case that they are facing an existential threat with Ukraine.//Lavrov on Friday noted an increase in weapons supplies to Ukraine and the growing number and scope of joint military drills conducted by Western powers with Ukraine, charging that “the Kyiv regime naturally perceives this support as a carte blanche for the use of force.” He added that Russia will protect its citizens living in eastern Ukraine.//“As for residents of Donbas, where hundreds of thousands of our citizens live, Russia will take all necessary measures to protect them,” he said. “An adequate response will be given to any possible military provocations by Kyiv against Donbas.”//Simon Miles, a diplomatic and international historian of the Cold War at Duke University, said it would be a mistake for the White House to let “Russia unilaterally set the tempo of what is about to unfold.”//“Whatever the U.S. can do to keep the Russians on their back foot, as opposed to letting the Kremlin set the agenda, is going to be important to securing a favorable resolution,” Miles said.//—-//Associated Press writer Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed to this report.", 8.1%
"Biden, Putin Hold Call As Tensions Mount Over Ukraine Crisis", "WILMINGTON, Del.

(AP) — Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin spoke Thursday amid growing alarm over  Russia’s troop buildup  near Ukraine, a simmering crisis that has become further complicated in recent days as the Kremlin has stepped up its calls for security guarantees and test fired hypersonic missiles to underscore its demands.//Putin requested the call, the second between the leaders this month, ahead of scheduled talks between senior U.S. and Russian officials set for Jan. 10 in Geneva.//White House officials said that the call began at 3:35 p.m. EST.//Russia has made clear it wants a written commitment that Ukraine will never be allowed to join NATO and that the alliance’s military equipment will not be positioned in former Soviet states, demands that the Biden administration has made clear are non-starters.//The White House said ahead of the call that Biden would tell Putin that a diplomatic path remains open even as the Russians have moved an estimated 100,000 troops toward Ukraine and Kremlin officials have turned up the volume on its demands for new guarantees from the U.S. and NATO.//Those demands are to be discussed during the talks in Geneva, but it remains unclear what, if anything, Biden would be willing to offer Putin in exchange for defusing the crisis.//Draft security documents Moscow submitted demand that NATO deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back its military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe.//The U.S. and its allies have refused to offer Russia the kind of guarantees on Ukraine that Putin wants, citing NATO’s principle that membership is open to any qualifying country. They agreed, however, to hold talks with Russia to discuss its concerns.//The security proposal by Moscow has raised the question of whether Putin is making unrealistic demands in the expectation of a Western rejection that would give him a pretext to invade.//Steven Pifer, a career foreign service officer who served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in the Clinton administration, said the Biden administration could engage on some elements of Russia’s draft document if Moscow is serious about talks.//Key NATO members have made clear there is no appetite for expanding the alliance in the near future. The U.S. and allies could also be receptive to language in the Russians’ draft document calling for establishing new consultative mechanisms, such as the NATO-Russia Council and a hotline between NATO and Russia.//“The draft treaty’s proposed bar on any NATO military activity in Ukraine, eastern Europe, the Caucasus, or Central Asia is an overreach, but some measures to limit military exercises and activities on a reciprocal basis might be possible,” Pifer, who is now a senior fellow at Brookings Institution,  wrote in an analysis for the Washington think tank.//Biden planned to tell Putin that for there to be “real progress” in the talks they must be conducted in “a context of de-escalation rather than escalation,” according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters before the call. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity.//The call was set up on Putin’s initiative, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday.//“The goal of the conversation is clear — to continue discussing the issues that were on the agenda during the recent conversation via video conference,” Peskov told reporters. That Dec. 7 call focused on the Russian troop movements, which have unsettled Ukraine and other European allies, as well as Moscow’s demand for security guarantees.//Peskov noted that since that call, Moscow submitted its security proposals to U.S. and European officials and now “from our point of view, from the point of view of President Putin, the need has arisen for another telephone conversation, which would preface the upcoming talks.”//Biden and Putin, who met in Geneva in June to discuss an array of tensions in the U.S.-Russia relationship, are not expected to take part in the January talks.//In the Dec. 7 video call, the White House said Biden put Moscow on notice that an invasion of Ukraine would bring sanctions and enormous harm to the Russian economy. Russian officials have dismissed the sanction threats.//Last week, Russia test-fired Zircon hypersonic missiles, a provocative move that Peskov said was meant to help make Russia’s push for security guarantees “more convincing.” The test was the first time Zircon missiles were launched in a salvo, indicating the completion of tests before the new missile enters service with the Russian navy next year and arms its cruisers, frigates and submarines.//Moscow and NATO representatives are expected to meet in the days after the Geneva talks, as are Russia and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which includes the United States.//Russia has denied an intention of launching an invasion and, in turn, accused Ukraine of hatching plans to try to reclaim control of the territories held by Moscow-backed rebels by force. Ukraine has rejected the claim.//At the same time, Putin has urged the West to move quickly to meet his demands, warning that Moscow will have to take “adequate military-technical measures” if the West continues its “aggressive” course “on the threshold of our home.”//As Biden prepared for the talks with Putin, the administration also sought to highlight the commitment to Ukraine and drive home that Washington is committed to the “principle of nothing about you without you” in shaping policy that affects European allies.//Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Blinken “reiterated the United States’ unwavering support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity in the face of Russia’s military buildup on Ukraine’s borders.”//In Thursday’s call, Biden is expected to stress to Putin that the U.S. is united with its allies but will demonstrate a willingness to engage in “principled diplomacy” with Russia, the administration official said.//But past military incursions by Putin loom large.//In 2014, Russian troops marched into the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and seized the territory from Ukraine. Russia’s annexation of Crimea was one of the darker moments for President Barack Obama on the international stage.//The U.S.-Russia relationship was badly damaged near the end of President George W. Bush’s administration after Russia’s 2008 invasion of its neighbor Georgia after Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili ordered his troops into the breakaway region of South Ossetia.//The two leaders are also expected during Thursday’s call to discuss efforts to persuade Iran to return to the 2015 nuclear accord, which was effectively scrapped by the Trump administration.//Despite differences on Ukraine and other issues, White House officials have said the Iran nuclear issue is one where they believe the U.S. and Russia can work cooperatively.//Biden, who is spending the week in his home state of Delaware, spoke to Putin from his home near Wilmington.//Ahead of the call, Putin sent a telegram to Biden with New Year’s and Christmas wishes, which was posted on the Kremlin site on Thursday, along with other holiday messages to world leaders.//“I am convinced that in the development of our agreements reached during the June summit in Geneva and subsequent contacts that we can move forward and establish an effective Russian-American dialogue based on mutual respect and in consideration of each other’s national interests,” Putin wrote.//___//Associated Press writers Dasha Litvinova and Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed to this report.", 8.5%
"Biden Orders Flags Be Flown At Half-Staff In Honor Of Harry Reid", "Reporter, HuffPost//Reporter, HuffPost//President Joe Biden has ordered that U.S. flags be flown at half-staff to honor former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on the day of his funeral.//Flags must be lowered at the White House, all public buildings and grounds, military posts and at various American facilities abroad on the day of Reid’s interment, Biden announced Wednesday.//“Throughout his long career of public service, Harry Reid was instrumental in passing landmark legislation that made a positive difference in the lives of countless Americans and made our Nation stronger and safer,” Biden said in a statement Monday. “His devoted service to our Nation was not about power for power’s sake. It was about the power to do right by the American people.”//Reid, a Democrat who represented Nevada in the U.S. Senate for 30 years until his retirement in 2017, died Tuesday at age 82. He was recognized as one of the most powerful figures in the history of the Democratic Party ― a role he ascended to from a childhood spent growing up in a house built out of old railroad ties.//“He was a man of action, and a man of his word — guided by faith, loyalty, and unshakeable resolve,” Biden said Wednesday.//Landra Reid, Reid’s wife of 62 years, said funeral arrangements will be announced in coming days.//“We greatly appreciate the outpouring of support from so many over these past few years,” she said Tuesday. “We are especially grateful for the doctors and nurses that cared for him.

"The Biden Administration Is Treating the Pandemic Like A Personal Problem", "////Why does December 2021 feel so much like March 2020?//That was the fateful month when the World Health Organization officially declared the novel coronavirus a pandemic. The NBA shut down, and former president Donald Trump banned travel from much of Europe. Offices scrambled to send their employees home and parents tried to navigate child care while schools shut down. Essential workers braced for the worst. //Since then, we’ve learned of the efficacy of masks and social distancing. Vaccines and boosters are widely available, as are treatments. And there’s even a new administration.//“We are looking at a winter of severe illness and death for the unvaccinated — for themselves, their families and the hospitals they’ll soon overwhelm,” President Joe Biden recently said at a White House press briefing. “But there’s good news: If you’re vaccinated and you have your booster shot, you’re protected from severe illness and death.”//While this statement may be true, it’s simply the liberal version of treating a pandemic as a personal responsibility rather than a collective one.//Where is the national testing strategy and contact tracing? Where is the push for economic aid to the industries and workers that remain hard hit? Telling off anti-vaxxers may be cathartic, but it’s not exactly a national public health strategy. Almost two years into the pandemic, a federally led collective response is still woefully lacking.//The shortcomings of our national plan are exemplified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s new recommendation that infected people can shorten their quarantine time from 10 days to five if they are asymptomatic. //Yes, science evolves. But it’s hard to believe the agency’s decision was based solely on science when the recommendation was also accompanied by an acknowledgment that too many workers in quarantine could hurt businesses.//“We want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science,” CDC director Rochelle Walensky said. So, is it about stopping the spread ... or getting people back to work?//Shortening quarantine times while the country smashes previous infection records is enough to give even the most well-informed people whiplash.//The ensuing confusion over the new recommendation brought to light just how little confidence the American public has in the nation’s top public health agency; not a great sign for a president who promised a “robust” federal health response.//When Trump left office, the official COVID death toll hit 400,000. Nearly one year later, the grim number is at more than 815,000. It wasn’t supposed to be like this.//Consider the early days of the pandemic. The Trump administration wasn’t even entirely convinced that COVID was a real problem. Despite mounting deaths, the former president spent most of his days downplaying the severity of illness and pushing to “reopen” the economy. The country’s first and only attempt at a lockdown lasted approximately four weeks, a period that was supposed to slow transmission of the virus while allowing the federal government to increase testing capacity and hospitals to increase capacity.//But by May 2020, Republican governors, itching to get people to spend money, allowed restaurants, gyms and concert venues to reopen their doors. Eating at a chain restaurant was apparently a God-given right and any attempt to blunt the effects of the pandemic was an infringement of that individual freedom. Meanwhile, economic aid rolled out slowly, widespread testing remained unavailable and hospitals were tragically overwhelmed.//The Trump administration’s non-plan forced the country into a patchwork of solutions. If you were lucky, your governor issued a mask mandate, limited mass gatherings and created virtual learning options for schoolchildren. But if your governor prayed at the altar of Trumpism, you were largely left to fend for your own.//By this fall, much of the financial aid packages passed by Congress had expired. Then in November, South African virologists announced that they had discovered a new coronavirus variant. Since then, omicron has spread rapidly around the globe and currently accounts for the vast majority of new cases in the U.S. But almost two years into the pandemic, getting tested for the virus can still be an uphill battle, whether one goes to a publicly-run site or tries to find rapid tests to take at home.//Despite this, White House press secretary Jen Psaki still scoffed at a reporter who asked her about tests earlier this month. //“Should we just send one to every American?” Psaki asked sarcastically despite the fact that other countries like the United Kingdom do just that.//Later, the White House announced that it would, in fact, be sending out rapid tests to American households starting in January. However, the plan was slim on details; we know that people will have to use a website to request them. Good thing federal government-run websites don’t have a history of being complete trainwrecks.//Omicron isn’t the first time the virus has mutated. When the delta variant began spreading here in July, it caused a surge. But Vice President Kamala Harris said during an interview with the Los Angeles Times that the administration “didn’t see” the omicron variant coming. An adviser later noted that Harris was referring to the exact mutations. //It would be unfair to say that Trump’s and Biden’s responses to the pandemic are the same. After all, even after Trump contracted COVID, he continued to downplay the threat. He continuously mocked mask-wearing and, in his final few weeks in office, quietly got vaccinated himself but failed to promote the vaccine. Biden has had to deal with Republican governors and those in Congress hellbent on blocking any Democratic efforts, and he certainly didn’t invent America’s penchant for rabid individualism. //But if the president is ultimately responsible for his country’s collective pandemic response, then Biden will have to shoulder some of the blame. //", 7.6%
"If You Like All The New Progressive Federal Judges, Thank Trump For Sabotaging Georgia", "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost//Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost//WASHINGTON ― If you like all the progressive judges that President Joe Biden has put on the federal bench since taking office, you can thank the one person without whom it could never have happened: Donald Trump.//The former president’s sabotage of two Georgia Senate runoffs in early January with his endless lies about “massive fraud” having cost him reelection almost certainly cost the two Republican incumbents their seats, giving Democrats control of the chamber and the ability to push through judicial nominations without a single GOP vote.//“Trump handed it to them,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia who studies federal judicial appointments, adding that Biden’s record-tying string of 40 district and appellate court judges in his first year would have been impossible in a Republican-controlled Senate. “They just wouldn’t have had the votes. I don’t know what they would have done.”//Biden has won praise from across the Democratic spectrum for judicial picks that have put Native American and other ethnic and racial minorities and members of the LGBTQ community on the federal bench. Biden has also drawn from a broader range of professional backgrounds ― public defenders and voting rights attorneys, for example, rather than just prosecutors and corporate lawyers ― than previous presidents, even previous Democratic presidents. Of the 40 Biden judges confirmed so far (35 more are already in the pipeline), a full 80% are women.//“I think very few of those people would have been confirmed,” Tobias said. “Biden would have pulled back and … chosen more moderates, picked more people who were less ideologically liberal.”//Among presidents in the last half century, only Republican Ronald Reagan was able to put as many judges on the federal bench in his first year. Trump, for example, was able to get only 18 seated in his first year.//Yet those nominees would have faced a much tougher path in a Senate run by Mitch McConnell with a 52-48 Republican majority, which appeared as if it would be the outcome in November 2020 after the votes were counted in Georgia with no candidate in either of the two Senate races receiving over 50%.//Georgia law requires a runoff in such cases, which in recent years have favored Republicans because of their more dutiful voters and their superior turnout operation. That historical advantage, though, was thrown away last January by the then-president, who was angry that he had lost Georgia and Arizona, two reliable GOP states, on his way to losing to Biden by 7 million votes nationally.//In interview after interview, speech after speech, Trump pushed the falsehood that the Nov. 3 election had been rigged against him, including in Georgia, where the rigging had been done by Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, both Republicans.//“There’s no way we lost Georgia. There’s no way. That was a rigged election,” Trump said right at the start of a Jan. 4 rally that was ostensibly to support Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue.//The end result, Trump’s election eve rally notwithstanding: GOP voters stayed home in droves while Democrat Stacey Abrams’ massive turnout effort helped Raphael Warnock defeat Loeffler and Jon Ossoff overtake Perdue.//According to an analysis by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 752,000 Georgians who cast ballots on Nov. 3, 2020, failed to do so on Jan. 5, 2021, with a disproportionate number of those no-shows coming from Republican strongholds, particularly the two areas of the state where Trump had held rallies. Meanwhile, 228,000 residents who had not voted in the general election did so in the runoff, most of whom were from Black and other minority communities, and nearly half of whom were younger than 35.//Warnock and Ossoff both come in second in their November 2020 races. Warnock won his runoff by 93,000 votes, and Ossoff won by 55,000.//Erick Erickson, a conservative radio talk-show host based in Atlanta, said Trump made it a loyalty test to go along with his false claims of a stolen election, and top Georgia Republicans, such as Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and state party chairman David Shafer, were happy to comply.//“It wasn’t just Trump. It was him, the state party chair, Marjorie Taylor Greene, etc., all screaming that the election was stolen and they were going to steal it again. Trump was certainly the loudest voice about it,” Erickson said. “Had they shut up, I don’t think you’d have seen 400,000-plus Republicans sit out the runoff.”//Without Trump’s sabotage, McConnell would likely have held a four-seat margin, and Biden would have faced the same roadblocks that Democrat Barack Obama faced in his final two years in the White House after McConnell became the Senate majority leader following the 2014 midterm elections.//“If Biden were able to get a half dozen judges through, most likely only district courts, in a McConnell-led Senate, that would be because Mitch was feeling especially generous,” said Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. “And Mitch does not feel generous.”//“The makeup of the federal judiciary is his legacy, and it is one to which he would go to great lengths to protect,” Mac Stipanovich, a longtime GOP consultant in Florida, said of McConnell. “Biden got lucky when Trump screwed the pooch in Georgia.”//Trump, nevertheless, has continued lying about the 2020 presidential election and has even actively recruited candidates to run against Kemp and Raffensperger in the Republican primary next year. In recent statements, he has blamed both Kemp and ― inexplicably ― McConnell for losing the two Senate seats rather than accepting any blame himself.//“He has all the cards to win, but not the ‘guts’ to play them. Instead, he gives our Country away, just like he did with the two Senate seats in Georgia, and the Presidency itself,” Trump said about McConnell in a statement he released Dec. 8, two days after claiming that Kemp “cost us two Senate seats and a Presidential victory in the Great State of Georgia.”//Trump’s political action committee staff did not respond to HuffPost queries about the statements.//Trump, despite losing the election by 7 million votes overall and by 306-232 in the Electoral College, became the first president in more than two centuries of elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully. His incitement of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol – his last-ditch attempt to remain in office ― killed five, including one police officer, injured another 140 officers and led to four police suicides.//Notwithstanding this, Trump remains the dominant figure in the Republican Party and is openly speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024. //Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost//
