[+] (Photo by Dirck Halstead/Getty Images)//US President Ronald W. Reagan speaking at a fundraiser for Senate Candidate Linda Chavez's campaign. ... [+] (Photo by Dirck Halstead/Getty Images)//Politicians are in the business of selling things: policies, ideas, parties — even themselves, once Election Day rolls around. To help close the deal, they deploy a range of experts, including pollsters, speechwriters, lobbyists, and high-level strategists.//Unraveling the process of political salesmanship is no small task; it provides (plausibly) gainful employment to thousands of journalists and scholars in a range of disciplines, from political science to linguistics to history and beyond.//Some of these explicators have focused particularly on the selling of tax reform. The history of federal taxation is marked by long stretches of relative continuity punctuated by moments of dramatic change. What makes those moments of change possible? How do politicians sell tax reform?//Typically, wars have been catalysts for transformative change in the nation’s revenue system: The great tax regimes of U.S. fiscal history have all been defined by wartime fiscal crises. These crises can make it easier to sell a set of tax policies, at least when the war itself enjoys broad popular support.//But what happens if we loosen the definition of transformative change just a bit? What if we look not just for the watershed moments dividing one tax regime from the next, but also for those moments of renewal, when major reforms breathe new life into aging regimes?//Using that broader definition, we find other moments of important tax change — most of them associated with major tax cuts://////Explaining this last episode — and specifically the successful Republican campaign to sell transformative tax cuts to voters, interest groups, and Democrats in Congress — is the principal focus of a new article by Inga Rademacher, a political scientist at King’s College London. Published in Policy Studies earlier this year, the article tries to unravel how Republicans went about “winning the votes for institutional change” to the tax law.//First, the big reveal: Compromise is vital to the legislative process. “This article argues that compromises — defined as strategic acts of conflict-resolution — can function as critical discursive instruments which enable agreement with different actors in the legislative process,” Rademacher writes.//Not exactly a shocking revelation. But also not as obvious as it might seem, because Rademacher isn’t talking simply about the sort of bargaining that goes on between parties or factions — the nuts and bolts of legislative compromise. She is also looking at other kinds of compromise, including how politicians can blend new ideas with more “traditional sentiments” that voters and interest groups bring to a policy debate.//Rademacher’s theoretical model for exploring these compromises is called “discursive institutionalism,” an analytical approach that “attempts to capture the role of preferences, values and strategies of actors and how ideational constructs, stories and narratives enable and constrain policy change.”//Which is a mouthful. But it’s also a useful approach to the analysis of political debate, especially since it focuses not only on the substance of ideas — do politicians argue about efficiency, for instance, of vertical equity? — but on how politicians manipulate ideas. “The focus is less on the substantive content of ideas and rather on the interactive processes through which ideas evolve,” Rademacher explains.//What does all this mean for the Reagan tax cuts, and specifically passage of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA)? Rademacher finds that the Reagan administration began with a “coordinative” campaign of coalition building, courting business interests with practical tax benefits that included the accelerated cost recovery system.//At the same time, the administration mounted a “communicative” campaign targeting Reagan’s conservative base and American voters more generally. //President Ronald Reagan sitting at desk in the Oval Office of the White House after adressing the ... [+] nation, re Iran-Contra affair. (Photo by Diana Walker/Getty Images)//This broadly focused communication strategy made an ideological case for individual tax cuts, stressing the value of small government, the utility of “starving the beast,” and the importance of indexing the tax system for inflation.//For Rademacher, the disconnect between Reagan’s coordinative and communicative campaigns proved problematic. Ultimately, it limited popular support for the law because the pro-business focus of the coordinative campaign eroded the fairness emphasis of the communicative strategy. //Voters grew increasingly disillusioned with business tax breaks that seemed to add unfairness to the tax system even as politicians were promising to reduce such inequities.//Rademacher contends that Democrats developed their own counternarrative around the 1981 law, one that tapped “traditional American values” regarding fiscal responsibility, balanced budgets, and vertical equity. Along the way, Democrats managed to align themselves with small business, as opposed to the big business champions of ACRS. //Ultimately, this counternarrative wasn’t powerful enough to stop Reagan’s drive for tax reform, but it did leave it vulnerable. “Its stability was compromised,” Rademacher writes. “In his second and third tax cut, Reagan was forced to reverse several elements of this reform.”//There’s room to quibble (or more) with Rademacher’s overview of the 1981 debate. //For instance, she glosses over complexities in the Reagan administration’s commitment to indexing, which was not as immediate or complete as she seems to suggest. And she conflates arguments about “horizontal equity” with complaints about “bracket creep,” which is either confusing or just plain wrong.//Perhaps most serious, Rademacher insists on claiming that the 1981 tax cut was a failure, arguing that it “did not withstand the test of time.” //She cites Boston University political science professor Cathie Jo Martin’s outstanding 1991 book on business taxation, Shifting the Burden: The Struggle Over Growth and Corporate Taxation, noting that Reagan was ultimately forced to undo several elements of ERTA later in the decade.//Narrowly construed, those reversals might be enough to call ERTA a failure — but only if you minimize its more durable, transformative components. //The individual rate cuts of 1981 may not have been chiseled in stone, for instance, but they marked a watershed in American fiscal politics. //As I argued recently: “ERTA knocked 20 percentage points off the top bracket rate, and the politics of post-ERTA taxation made no room for restoring that rate to its pre-Reagan heights — or anything even close. After 1981, 50 percent was the new 70 percent. And after a few more years, 28 percent was the new 70 percent.”//More important, indexing transformed the nature of U.S. fiscal politics, eliminating the unlegislated tax increases that had helped sustain government spending for decades. By eliminating bracket creep and its automatic annual revenue boost, indexing put new limits on government. //In his history of the episode, historian W. Elliot Brownlee offered this pithy quote from Reagan’s Treasury Secretary Donald Regan: “My favorite part of the tax bill is the indexing provision — it takes the sand out of Congress’s sandbox.”//UNITED STATES - DECEMBER 01: Secretary of Treasury Don Regan testifying before House Banking & ... [+] Currency Committee re IMF. (Photo by Diana Walker/Getty Images)//Finally, Rademacher could do a better job in positioning her article within the existing literature. In a bid to justify her contribution, she unreasonably minimizes the value of other works. //She suggests, for instance, that historical analyses of taxation in the United States tend to emphasize continuity over change — to the point of making change inexplicable.//But that reading of the historical literature is sustainable only if you omit the work of several actual historians; scholars like Brownlee and Ajay Mehrotra have described episodes of major change in the American tax system, explaining them as a function of external crises, institutional dynamics, and democratic pressure. //I think historians can also help explain the reforms of 1981 (as, indeed, Brownlee already has). And ignoring historical analysis of the 1981 episode tends to make arguments offered during that pivotal episode seem more novel than they actually were.//When the Reagan administration started talking about rate cuts (or base broadening, or investment incentives, or indexing), they were not simply crafting a case from thin air — or the fever dreams of conservative think tanks and trickle-down ideologues. These ideas had long histories, some stretching back before World War II.//Rademacher casts the Reagan tax cuts as part of a cross-national, neoliberal tax cutting project — one that swept the world starting in the 1970s. And she’s not wrong. But that project did not arise fully formed in the 1970s, let alone a decade later in Reagan’s White House: It had a history.//That history doesn’t make the 1981 tax cuts any less important, or even less radical. But it does help explain how and why Reagan officials settled on the particular package of cuts that eventually found their way into ERTA. It also illuminates why they chose certain arguments to defend those cuts. The history of an argument matters to its resonance, as Rademacher implies with her discussion of “traditional sentiments.”//Despite such complaints, Rademacher has offered some important insights on the 1981 debate over ERTA. Her effort to tease apart the disjointed communication strategy helps explain, for instance, why Democrats were able to find some traction for their counternarrative. //And while she exaggerates the power of that narrative, she is correct that Democrats managed to force Republicans into some genuine legislative compromise.//The Republican contradictions may also help explain why Reagan was forced to accept several of the tax increases that marked his later years in office. Reconciling pro-business arguments with fairness arguments would prove difficult in the years to come.//Finally, Rademacher does a service in reminding us that balanced-budget arguments can sometimes be important in tax debates. It’s fashionable these days to dismiss those arguments as irrelevant. And there’s more than a little evidence to bolster that view.//Northwestern University

 sociologist Monica Prasad has argued that “ERTA transformed the Republican Party from a party of fiscal rectitude into a party whose main domestic policy goal is to cut taxes.” //That first tax cut of the Reagan era “taught Republicans that tax cuts could be popular — something that was not clear at the time, because for decades before then opinion polls had shown strong and consistent opposition to deficits,” she contends.//On balance, I think Prasad has that story right. But the transition to “deficits don’t matter” was not a smooth one. Nor was it ever complete. //I may be one of the few left standing, but I’m still convinced that deficits do matter to American voters. Or at least, might matter. We just haven’t encountered large deficits in a politically and economically salient context for a long time. A context, say, marked by high inflation.//That could change.//", 9.9%
"John Hinckley—Attempted Assassin Of President Reagan—Wins Unconditional Release", "A U.S. federal judge on Monday approved the unconditional release of John Hinckley Jr., who shot then President Ronald Reagan and three others outside a Washington, D.C., hotel in 1981, after he and his lawyers reached an agreement with federal prosecutors.//A U.S. federal judge on Monday approved the unconditional release of John Hinckley Jr., who shot then President Ronald Reagan and three others outside a Washington, D.C., hotel in 1981, after he and his lawyers reached an agreement with federal prosecutors.//Armed Secret Service agents surround the bodies of policeman Thomas K. Delahanty and White House ... [+] press secretary James Brady while the suspect, John Hinckley Jr., is apprehended outside the Washington Hilton Hotel, Washington, D.C., March 30, 1981.//The Justice Department reached a deal with Hinckley, 66, to free him from the stringent conditions and court supervision he's been living under since 2016, when he was granted a conditional release.//Senior U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman said at a court hearing Monday that he will officially approve the terms in writing later this week, asserting, “Very few patients at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital have been studied more thoroughly than John Hinckley.”//Hinckley’s unconditional release will take effect in June 2022.//The agreement includes observation required by prosecutors and a government medical expert over the next nine months, but will not require any additional approval from the court. //Hinckley attempted to assassinate Reagan, the country’s 40th president, on March 30, 1981, using a .22 caliber revolver. It was revealed in court testimony that Hinckley, who was 25 at the time, told authorities he hoped that assassinating Reagan would impress movie star Jodie Foster. Hinckley ended up wounding Reagan, White House press secretary James Brady, Secret Service Special Agent Tim McCarthy and Metropolitan Police Department Officer Thomas Delahanty. Brady was paralyzed and critically injured in the attack, dying from his injuries 33 years later. In 1982, a jury found Hinckley not guilty by reason of insanity, as jurors decided Hinckley was suffering from acute psychosis and determined he needed treatment for mental illness as opposed to life in prison. Following the verdict, Hinckley was committed to St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington, D.C. He spent more than 30 years in the government psychiatric hospital before restrictions placed upon him were gradually reduced. In 2016, after psychiatrists and the court found he no longer posed a danger to himself or others, Hinckley was granted conditional release to his mother's home in Williamsburg, Virginia. Last year, the Department of Behavioral Health proposed an unconditional release, asserting he posed “low risk for future violence.” Hinckley's attorney, Barry Levine, said his client’s mental disease is “in full, stable and complete remission and has been so for over three decades.” Hinckley has been ordered to stay away from Foster, as well as the families of Reagan and others wounded during the attack. //“Mr. Hinckley wants to express apologies. His apologies are heartfelt and ones of profound regret,” said Levine. “Perhaps it is too much to ask for forgiveness, but we hope to have an understanding that the acts that caused him to do this terrible thing were the product of mental illness.”//Shortly after the passing of James Brady, in August 2014, the medical examiner's office in Virginia ruled the death a homicide resulting from the gunshot wound he suffered in Hinckley’s assassination attempt. However, in 2015, federal prosecutors said they would not charge Hinckley with murder. Brady was the first person shot in the 1981 attack. He was struck above the left eye, and the bullet shattered into more than two-dozen fragments. Brady underwent multiple surgeries to stop spinal fluid from leaking from his cranial cavity and an operation for a pulmonary embolism within his first three months in the hospital. Brady would go on to become one of the nation’s leading advocates of gun control, spearheading the fight to require background checks for handguns bought from federally licensed dealers.//U.S. judge will grant unconditional release of would-be Reagan assassin John W.

President Bill Clinton was a close friend of President George H.W. Bush and remains quite friendly with President George W. Bush.//If Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill were still around they'd probably be Facebook friends, but the same can't be said for many lawmakers today.//As CNN reported last week, many members within the House of Representatives said that they increasingly find themselves in a toxic work environment, one that is wrought with bitter exchanges, threats, and fears about the erosion of decorum in the chamber.//This comes just weeks after Democrats and two Republicans voted to censure Rep.

"The Morning Of 9/11 From Inside US Airways’ HQ Near Reagan National Airport", "A flag shows where American flight 77 was crashed into the pentagon on 9/11. These attacks affected ... [+] the world and the airline industry in significant ways.,//A flag shows where American flight 77 was crashed into the pentagon on 9/11. These attacks affected ... [+] the world and the airline industry in significant ways.,//I drove to work as US Airway’s senior vice president of marketing on the morning of 9/11, still bothered by the fact that the New York Giants had lost to the Denver Broncos on Monday Night Football the evening before. It was a nice morning and driving down the GW Parkway was one of the nicest commutes I’ve had in my career, with sites of the Potomac River, and many of D.C.’s notable monuments in view. Like everyday in this role, there were a lot of meetings scheduled and more to do than time to do it.//Nothing seemed unusual. But we all know what happened that morning, and on its 20th anniversary there have been many stories and remembrances, and lots of thinking about how that morning changed so many things in the world. Here is how things unfolded from my office at the airline’s headquarters.//US Airways was based in a nondescript high-rise building in Crystal City, Virginia, and occupied several floors. I worked on the fourth floor in the center. Our head of pricing, Stephen Usery, had his office at the far end of the hall. Stephen had a television in his office which he generally kept on business news. Within minutes of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center, we were aware of what happened and watched the video shown on the television. The initial report was that a “small plane” had hit the north tower. //Just after 9am, when the second plane hit the south tower, two things were clear: it was not a small plane, it was a commercial jet, and this was an attack, not an accident. At this point, Stephen looked looked at me and said, “it must be Osama Bin Laden.” It surprised me that he seemed so certain, but then we talked about the earlier failed attempt to down the towers with truck bombs in 1993. By this point, most of our colleagues who worked on the floor were discussing the events. I called a group together to see what we could or should do in response, as my team was responsible for the company’s website and we felt that’s where most customers would go for answers. No US Airways plane was used in the attacks, so we did not have direct customer issues related to the attack at that time.//The third plane crashed into the Pentagon about 30 minutes later, only about a mile from our building. After three attacks, it seemed clear that this was aimed at big image targets and one person wondered out loud if the Pentagon bombing was a backup for a plan to hit a more emotional target like the Capitol or the White House. At this point, I called my wife, who was the principal of an elementary school in Alexandria, Virginia. I got hold of her and asked if she knew what happening, and she told me that her school was being put into a lockdown. This meant no one could leave or enter, but at that point most of the school was unaware of the outside events. //As I walked out of my office, another colleague came to to me, visibly shaken, saying that she had come to the office late because of an early morning dentist appointment and saw the plane hit the Pentagon on her drive in. She was listening to her radio so knew what had just happened in New York. Then, we got word from our System Operations Center that the airspace in the U.S. was being shut down for commercial traffic and that all aircraft on the air were ordered to land at the closest airport. For an airline, this was shocking news but certainly seemed appropriate since it was not clear how many more planes would be used as bombs. We also knew that we would have many customer issues to deal with as the the rest of the day’s flights were cancelled and many people would be landing at spots other than their chosen destination. //When the fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania, it was confusing. Only later would we hear about the heroes on that flight who wouldn't allow their hijackers to reach their intended target. This crash created a new concern, though, as it was unclear if there were more planes that had been commandeered. This “is it over?” feeling lasted for hours until the media seemed confident that planes had landed and there were no more known instances of hijackings. //The day’s schedule was obviously thrown out by then, and the rest of the day was a series of meetings dealing with customer issues, aircraft issues, and crew issues. While no US Airways planes were used in the attacks, we had flights returning from Europe that were forced to land in Canada and this gave our teams a lot to consider.//U.S. airspace reopened to commercial traffic on September 13 for planes to get positioned back to where they should be. The flight scheduling, marketing, and operations teams worked to rebuild the schedule against a dramatically reduced number of bookings. The next few weeks were a whirlwind of activity, trying to understand what these events meant for the company, the industry, and the practical issues of employee and customer care. But Reagan National Airport, DCA, did not re-open and as this was one of US Airway’s most important operating bases, this was a big concern. Shuttle flights to NY and Boston were moved to Washington’s Dulles airport with DCA closed.//The attacks temporarily closed the capital markets to airlines, as lenders felt the industry was far too risky. In response, the U.S. Treasury created the Air Transportation Stabilization Board (ATSB) to provide credit to airlines. Airlines had to apply, and some were approved and others denied. US Airways received the largest loan, in part because of unique ways in which the attacks affected the carrier, including the long closure of DCA and the high dependence on short flights in and around the northeast.//On November 12, an American flight from New York’s JFK airport crashed. The immediate thoughts about this was, “Oh no, is this another attack?” It is uncomfortable to say that there a was huge relief when it was determined this was unrelated to the previous attacks. On November 28, US Airways CEO Rakesh Gangwal unexpectedly resigned. Stephen Wolf, the Chairman of the company and one-time United Airlines CEO, took over daily running of the company while a search began for a new CEO. This leadership change added even more uncertainty to a company that just months earlier was planning to merge with United Airlines. DCA finally reopened in late October, but the company had been planning what to do in the event that the airport was permanently closed. //US Airways planes were not used in the 9/11 attacks but these attacks disproportionally affected the airline. Stephen Usery, our pricing head who had quickly and correctly guessed the source of the attacks, used his cynical wit to say that the company’s once proud aspiration to become a “world class global airline” should be now changed to “half-assed regional feeder.” This was unfortunately close to true.//The ATSB loan helped to keep the company alive but US Airways still became the first airline to enter bankruptcy protection following the attacks. Eventually most airlines, with the notable exception of Southwest, used bankruptcy to restructure, change their fleets, and reject defined benefit pension plans for retired employees. These restructurings then led to a chain of mergers, in which eight large U.S. airlines became four huge airlines. These consolidations closed or significantly downsized multiple hubs in the U.S., raised fares for consumers, and created an environment that allowed ultra-low fare carriers like Spirit, which I served as CEO of from 2005-16, to flourish. //One thing that struck me, even on the day of the attacks, was the very light passenger loads on the airplanes. The attacks were on a Tuesday, which is the day of week with the fewest travelers. It is chilling to think that the planners of the attack actually considered this fact, as fewer passengers would mean less resistance to their take-overs. It also shows the calculated, callous, and unadulterated evil that propagated these attacks.//", 6.9%
"The Coronavirus And The Balance Of Power Between Employers And Employees", "Stronger rights for employees is an unexpected silver lining to the otherwise negative effects of ... [+] the coronavirus.//Stronger rights for employees is an unexpected silver lining to the otherwise negative effects of ... [+] the coronavirus.//Throughout American history, there’s been an ebb and flow to the power of the employee. The early stages of the industrial revolution showed the vulnerability of the American worker. In response, there was a rise in collective bargaining and labor unions. Yet the influence of collective action didn’t take full effect until the New Deal.//But things flipped back after the 1981 strike of air traffic controllers. When then-President Ronald Reagan fired the striking workers and hired replacements, this led to a long-term weakening of labor union power.//In the past decade or so, the power pendulum has shifted back and forth between employers and employees. But the most recent swing appears to be due to the coronavirus pandemic and in the workers’ favor. Let’s take a more detailed look and begin by examining the employment landscape in the years leading up to the arrival of the coronavirus. //Employers Have the Upper Hand//Employers have had several recent and notable advantages over their employees.//In 2017 the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) handed down two rulings that severely hindered employee rights. First, there was Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis. In this case, SCOTUS concluded that employers may require their employees to individually arbitrate employment disputes and forego their right to collective legal action.//Next, there was Janus v. AFSCME. Here, SCOTUS overturned decades-old precedent and ruled that public employers could no longer require their employees to pay union dues.//Attempts to pass federal legislation to mandate a $15/hour minimum wage or provide for paid family and medical leave had also failed. Additionally, caregiver discrimination was legal under federal law.//And not only had Congress failed to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, there had been no increase in the last 12 years. This had resulted in a 21% drop in earnings for the minimum wage worker due to inflation. //Gig workers were having trouble getting the same rights as employees. For example, California’s voters approved Proposition 22 in November 2020. This law gives gig-economy employers the right to classify their workers as independent contractors instead of employees. //While a California court just ruled that Proposition 22 violated California’s constitution (this decision is expected to be appealed), this hasn’t stopped other states, like Massachusetts, from trying to follow California’s lead.//But due to political and social changes, the tide began to shift back in the employee’s favor.//Employees Get More Rights//Before the coronavirus, a major reason for greater employee power was due to the #MeToo movement. The effect of this increased awareness of sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination has been enormous. //There’s been an increase in the use of clawback provisions when wrongful behavior involves sexual misconduct by executives. Toxic corporate culture gets more attention, which can lead to legal action. And the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act no longer allows an employer to deduct the payment of money to settle a sexual harassment or abuse claim when the settlement is subject to a nondisclosure agreement.//Most federal employees are now eligible to take up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave, thanks to the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act (FEPLA).//The U.S. Department of Labor updated its regulations to make it easier for workers to be eligible for minimum wage and overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).//States like Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia began cracking down on employers abusing noncompete agreements, especially with lower-wage earners.//Finally, in Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, SCOTUS determined that sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination was illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.//This trend has continued with the coronavirus pandemic, although less through legislative or judicial methods and more through economic forces.//How the Coronavirus Has Continued to Shift Power Back to Employees//One of the biggest effects of the coronavirus has been with the labor market. Specifically, employers have trouble filling their open positions. //The enhanced unemployment benefits have been blamed, which some believe encouraged too many people to stay home and not work. But when those benefits ended, any effect on the worker shortage has been minimal.//The reasons for this labor market dynamic are probably best explained in someone’s Ph.D. dissertation, but some of the reasons likely include://////Whatever the reasons, workers are now more likely to quit to find a better job or strike to improve their working conditions at their current job.//But it’s not just employees feeling more comfortable with switching careers or taking collective action. Corporate boards that decide how companies are run are feeling the pressure to do more for workers in light of the coronavirus.//Corporate law has long established the legal duty of a corporate board to identity organizational threats and take reasonable measures to reduce or eliminate those threats. And it’s safe to say that the coronavirus poses both an economic and health threat to companies and their workers.//This means that corporate boards are likely to support the use of vaccine mandates for their workers, as well as other coronavirus risk mitigation measures, like wearing masking and regular testing. This makes sense, given how workers are more likely to support a vaccine or mask mandate than oppose it.//Corporate boards must also oversee these policies and take the necessary steps to also comply with applicable federal, state and local guidelines and laws.//The Bottom Line//Before the pandemic, the U.S. labor market was primed for major changes, especially for the benefit of employees. The coronavirus might be the push needed to bring about these changes.//", 10.2%
"Reagan’s Tax Cut Just Turned 40 — And It’s Still The Most Important Tax Reform Since World War II", "President Ronald Reagan, campaigning for a second term of office, smiles during a rally speech at ...

[+] the California State Capitol the day before the 1984 presidential election. (Photo by © Wally McNamee/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images)//Ronald Reagan made tax cuts the centerpiece of his 1980 campaign for the presidency. And after winning the election, he made good on his promise. //The Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA), enacted on August 13, 1981, was the biggest tax cut in American history. It was also remarkably durable, reshaping the federal tax system — and American politics — for decades to come. //First some numbers: Reagan’s tax cut slashed revenues by 2.9% of GDP, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. That makes it the biggest tax cut since the introduction of the modern income tax in 1913, surpassing even the mammoth cuts passed after World War II (2.7% of GDP in 1945 and 1.9% in 1948). //Needless to say, ERTA also eclipses the 2017 tax cut; despite former President Trump’s repeated claim that his cut was the biggest, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act clocked in at just 0.6% of GDP. //Now it has to be said that the 1981 tax cut didn’t remain quite so big; almost immediately after Reagan signed the bill into law, his economic advisers started looking for ways to unravel it. Worried by grim deficit forecasts, they unveiled a collection of “revenue enhancements” designed to slow the river of red ink flowing from the treasury. //Reagan would eventually agree to a series of tax hikes; taken together, they reduced the size of the 1981 cut by almost half, according to Bruce Bartlett, who had a hand in drafting ERTA while working for the Reagan administration.//So the 1981 tax cut started big . . . and then got smaller. But all that initial bigness mattered, establishing Reagan’s bona fides as a tax reformer — and as someone who would deliver on his promises. In the short term, that mattered for U.S. electoral politics.//But other aspects of the 1981 tax law were even more important — and had even more profound consequences. When Reagan arrived at the White House, the top marginal income tax rate for individuals was 70%. ERTA slashed it to 50% while also lowering rates in lower brackets. //Five years later, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 would lower (and consolidate) rates even more. //These rate reductions were economically important, especially when coupled with the elimination of tax preferences in the 1986 tax reform. But not all of them proved durable; Congress began to fiddle with the rates (and the tax base) almost immediately. Many of the reforms were undone within a few years.//US Congress dome closeup with background of water fountain splashing, American flag waving in ... [+] Washington DC, USA closeup on Capital capitol hill, columns, pillars, nobody//But one aspect of the rate cuts proved very durable: Lawmakers never seriously reconsidered Reagan’s drastic cuts at the top end of the income scale. //ERTA knocked 20 percentage points off the top bracket rate, and the politics of post-ERTA taxation made no room for restoring that rate to its pre-Reagan heights — or anything even close. After 1981, 50% was the new 70%. And after a few more years, 28% was the new 70%. //Lopping 20 points off the top rate was just one of the two transformative achievements embedded in ERTA. The other was tax system indexing. //Before 1981, inflation would regularly push taxpayers into higher brackets, boosting revenue through a process known as “bracket creep.” It was a convenient way to raise more revenue — painful for hapless taxpayers but painless for the gutless lawmakers. //ERTA put an end to the bracket creep by requiring that key elements of the tax system be indexed for inflation. That ended easy finance, forcing lawmakers to confront unpleasant realities and make hard choices. It permanently transformed fiscal politics. //Finally, ERTA changed American politics well beyond the fiscal realm. As sociologist Monica Prasad argued in her outstanding 2018 book, Starving the Beast: Ronald Reagan and the Tax Cut Revolution, the 1981 tax cut taught Republicans that tax cuts could be the ticket to victory. //“This first tax cut taught Republicans that tax cuts could be popular — something that was not clear at the time, because for decades before then opinion polls had shown strong and consistent opposition to deficits,” Prasad writes. //“ERTA transformed the Republican Party from a party of fiscal rectitude into a party whose main domestic policy goal is to cut taxes.” That transformation, moreover, proved extremely durable — far more durable than ERTA itself. //Nowadays, it’s fashionable to talk about the 1986 tax reform as a watershed moment in the history of American taxation. And in some respects it was: It was certainly the apotheosis of good intentions in fiscal policymaking.//Ultimately, however, it’s ERTA that deserves the crown for Most Important Tax Law in Living Memory. Because ERTA did more than change the tax system: It changed America.//", 8.8%
"Viral Video: Reagan Told Same Joke As Biden, But The Gipper Actually Nailed It", "President Joe Biden speaks at the commencement for the United States Coast Guard Academy in New ... [+] London, Conn., Wednesday, May 19, 2021. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)//President Joe Biden speaks at the commencement for the United States Coast Guard Academy in New ... [+] London, Conn., Wednesday, May 19, 2021. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)//On Wednesday, President Joe Biden traveled to New London, Connecticut and gave the Coast Guard Academy's Commencement address. Such an event is as big a moment for a new president as it is for the cadets.//Biden took to social to media, writing, "I was honored to speak at the Coast Guard Academy's Commencement today. To the class of 2021: congratulations. May God protect you all as you set out on your journeys, and may God protect all those who wear the uniform of the United States of America."//However, what might be most remembered by those cadets in attendance wasn't Biden's upholding of the tradition of absolving graduates of all "minor infractions," or even the story he told of a college prank he actually committed.//Rather what might have been the most memorable moment of the speech were the poor choice of words the "commander in chief" chose when describing the cadets. After attempting to poke some humor at the U.S. Navy's expense, Biden suggested the graduates – newly minted officers of the United States Coast Guard – were a "dull class."//In his first commencement address as the nation's commander in chief, President Biden fumbled an old joke badly, "I can only assume that you'll enjoy educating your family about how the Coast Guard is quote 'The hard nucleus around the Navy forms in times of war.'"//Silence soon followed, and instead of merely moving on Biden doubled down.//"You're a really dull class. Come on, man," Biden added. "Is the sun getting to you? I would think you'd have an opportunity when I say that about the Navy to clap."//Several conservative commentators and political pundits pounced on Biden, and shared video of the president scolding the cadets.//Recycled Material//While many chalked up Biden's reaction as his being authentic, several others quickly pointed out that Biden's joke wasn't even original. Video surfaced on Wednesday afternoon that showed that the late President Ronald Reagan used the same line back in 1988 while giving the Coast Guard commencement speech.//"My Coast Guard aides have been excellent," Reagan told the cadets. "One of them taught me that, and I quote, 'The Coast Guard is that hard nucleus about which the Navy forms in time of war."//Not only did the Gipper not flub the line, but he actually received the cheers Biden expected. Washington Examiner's Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) shared the video on social media, and by Thursday morning it had nearly 32,000 likes and was retweeted more than 10,000 times.//Adams also added, "fyi, Reagan delivered this joke in 1988, at the end of his presidency and when dementia rumors were rampant."//This wasn't the first time President Biden has been accused of "borrowing" liberally, but as Adams noted Biden also wasn't the actually first to "recycle" the quip.//"also, guys, i wouldn't say the joke is plagiarized," wrote Adams. "Reagan said he heard it from a Coastie. Dick Cheney also told the joke in 2008. It's an old bit."//It's In The Delivery//However, the fact that video was posted comparing Reagan's delivery to Biden's should serve as a warning to would-be comedians to "hone" their act, but also to move on when a joke doesn't land. Social media can quickly and easily dredge up the past, and you don't want to be upstaged by someone who did a superior job many years earlier. But you also don't want your reaction to live on forever either.//"It is a sign of our times that everything we say will be recorded and used against us," warned technology and telecommunications analyst Roger Entner of Recon Analytics.//"Ideally, you use new material every time you speak, especially as the president, and if an old joke bombs you graciously move on," Entner added. "Someone is always watching for you to slip up and interpret it in the worst way. It comes with the territory."//For the record, the line should already be well known to those who serve in the United States Coast Guard. Writing for the Coast Guard Compass, Lt. Eric D. Nielsen explained, "All who enter Coast Guard boot camp are asked a seemingly innocuous indoctrination question: 'What is the Coast Guard?' To which the appropriate response is: 'The Coast Guard is the hard nucleus about which the Navy forms in times of war, sir!'"//", 9.5%
"Ronald Reagan’s Favorite Window", "getty//getty//The morning after the first Presidential debate, I woke saddened that the moderator needed to ask whether the candidates would honor a peaceful transition or felt the need to ask them to denounce white supremacy. I watched a debate that was embarrassing, and I woke wanting to recall a different time, different Presidents, and different Presidential challengers—if only so I could explain to my three daughters that it was not always like this.//Remembering that Ronald Reagan talked of our country as a “city upon a hill,” using the poetry of John Winthrop describing America as an early pilgrim, I watched Reagan’s last conversation with us as President. Technically I suppose it was an address to the nation but seeing him you find yourself feeling more like being on a walk with your grandfather. //He first confesses that being President for eight years left him somewhat apart from the rest of us, “You spend a lot of time going by too fast in a car someone else is driving, and seeing people through tinted glass – the parents holding up a child, and the wave you saw too late and couldn’t return.” But within the cloister that comes with the Presidency, he takes you to a window that looks over and past the Washington Monument. As he does so, one can’t help feeling the sun rising with him, and for a quick moment fooled into thinking you’re alone with him. “On mornings when the humidity is low, you can see past the Jefferson to the river, the Potomac and the Virginia shore…Well, I see more prosaic things: the grass on the banks, the morning traffic as people make their way to work, and now and then a sailboat on the river.”//The sailboat, he says, reminds him of a “small story about a big ship.” He tells of a sailor working on the carrier Midway, patrolling the South China Sea, who spies a “leaky little boat,” packed with refugees from Indochina searching for refuge, a shining city upon a hill.//“The Midway sent a small launch to bring them to the ship, and safety. As the refugees made their way through the choppy seas, one spied the sailor on deck, and stood up and called out to him. He yelled, ‘Hello, American sailor – Hello Freedom Man.’ ”//In what I choose to believe was not pretended modesty but revelation, Reagan insists that such ideas were not rhetoric from a great communicator but something more. “I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things, and they didn’t spring full bloom from my brow,” but instead came from the “heart of a great nation.” The heart he refers to is common experience, mutual wisdom and a mutual belief in guiding principles. Not competing tribal hearts, but a single heart we are both forced, and privileged, to share.//I suppose that is the same heart that once beat together among Americans, under which the President and Democrat Tip O’Neal could craft legislation over steak dinners together.//Out his beloved window, he leaves us with the promise of a “tall proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans,” telling us, “if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors, and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.” Then, in that moment with all of America gazing out the window with him, the sun higher in the sky, he asks us a question which I take to be instead a challenge. I believe he wanted his next words to be meant for us individually—to me as a father and husband and friend. Like a small story about a big ship, this City is ours to take care of, and he requests we ask of each other a question now and then, “How Stands the City?”//", 14.0%

[+] Extra-Terrestrial,' and 'The Hitcher.'//C. Thomas Howell's resume includes such classics as 'Red Dawn,' 'The Outsiders,' 'E.T. the ... [+] Extra-Terrestrial,' and 'The Hitcher.'//“I’ve played historical figures before, but this was different. I played Thomas Chamberlain in Gettysburg and Gods and Generals, and I did LBJ with Woody Harrelson and director Rob Reiner, but here’s the thing with somebody like Caspar Weinberger. There’s a lot of factual information made available, but how do you interpret facts?” mused C. Thomas Howell, the actor cast as the controversial politician in the new biographical historical drama film Reagan. //“Weinberger was a businessman, he was a quiet guy who got caught up in the Iran-Contra affair, and he got pardoned. Some things went a bit sideways for him; it unraveled at the end, he wasn’t known as a super likable guy, and he was known more for his ruthlessness and his cutting edge decision making with budgets. He didn’t make a whole lot of friends, but that wasn’t his job. If I was playing Ronald Reagan, what a responsibility you have there, but Caspar, you knew he was edgy, that Reagan loved him. I carry a pocket knife everywhere I go, and that’s how I looked at Caspar. He was Reagan’s pocket knife. When you need it, it is probably the thing you need most at that moment. It’s not like I’ve been dreaming about playing Caspar Weinberger. It was bigger than that, for me, it, it was an opportunity to learn.”//Part of the learning curve for Howell was being part of an ensemble cast lead by Dennis Quaid as former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, but the other was making it happen under COVID protocols.//“We used to be able to gather in makeup trailers and other places, and that’s where the actors would connect, exchange ideas, run dialogue, hug it out, and connect before the start of the day. Well, that has all been taken away,” Howell explained. “When it was time to eat lunch, I’d go sit in my trailer and eat by myself. When we rehearsed, we were not six feet apart, we were about ten feet apart, in a giant hall, and we were all raising our voices so people, which felt like they were a soccer pitch away, could understand us. It was a very different experience, but I was so grateful for the whole thing. After every COVID test, every precaution, there I was in front of Dennis with the lights, the cameras, doing what I love the most. It’s funny how they say the show must go on, but for Reagan, that really was the case.” //As well as Quaid and Howell, the cast also includes Penelope Ann Miller as Nancy Reagan, Mena Suvari, Kevin Dillon, and Lesley-Anne Down, who plays another controversial political figure, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. It was recently announced that Xander Berkeley would be portraying late former secretary of state, George Shultz.//Howell enthused, “I was a fan of so many of these actors and we all sort of had the same attitude. There was a pride to be there in a way. I’m always proud to do the best work I can, but this had a different vibe. It just was like, ‘F*** COVID. We’re going to create,’ and that meant a lot to me. Honestly, my job was to make Dennis look even better than he already is because he is incredible.  I was there to support him in the scenes that I was doing. It wasn’t about me. It was about being a team player, and that’s exactly what Caspar was.”//“We’re all trying to figure out how to make films under these new circumstances and still have insurance that’s effective but fair. It’s taken a lot of independent film out of the game. The studios don’t need to bond their films because they have the money to make sure that whatever happens, they’ll get it done and get it out, but the private money in and the independent films all took a giant right hook to the jaw,” he continued. “What happens if everybody gets COVID and you got to shut down? So, thank God the vaccine is happening. I know that the year was very tough on all artists. I had three projects significant to me, creatively and financially, that were affected. One canceled, and two I’m hoping will still go. I honestly thought I would be doing a different film, and I would have been unavailable for this, but Reagan’s producers were so patient with me. I think I got lucky, though. The casting director really wanted me to do it even though, and I was done filming in a week. I got a call from the producer, Mark Joseph, to tell me how he’d like me to be involved and when that happens, that’s when I was in because it became personal. I am extremely important to some people, but to someone else, I’m just one of the five names on the list that they’re hoping to get. On this one, I felt like they wanted me. I wasn’t just a name.”//C. Thomas Howell as Secretary of Defense for President Reagan, Caspar Weinberger, in 'Reagan.'//Howell starring opposite Quaid, an actor he has admired for decades, has been a long time coming. It turns out the pair share several connections.//“My father was one of the most prominent stuntmen in the business, and he still works a little bit in that area, but had done probably three or four pictures with Dennis, one of them was Wilder Napalm. Dennis and I shared a lot of great stories about his experience with my dad, so we were able to connect on a personal level there,” Howell explained. “We both started in the industry quite young, so we related on that level and shared some stories. We had that six degrees of separation thing going on, but we never did anything together until now. Dennis was dating Lea Thompson when she and I did Red Dawn. That’s a movie that means a lot to me.”//“Red Dawn was the first-ever PG-13 rated movie. They counted every bullet fired by the machine guns and then said something like it was the most violent movie ever made at the time. It put me over the top. I can’t tell you how many men my age come up to me on a weekly basis and say things like, ‘Oh my God, but when I was 15 years old, I got grounded for the summer for creating a spider hole in the backyard and destroying the lawn.’ Every blue-collar guy I know has a grease-covered cherished copy of Red Dawn in the camper or the cabin or the barn or garage.”//Red Dawn grossed $38 million against a $17 million budget. It was met with mixed reviews on its release is now considered an 80s classic. Another of Howell’s movies that has become a favorite, The Hitcher, celebrates a milestone in 2021. It turns 35. Will the actor mark the occasion?//“We have to do something, don’t we? Since Rutger Hauer passed, I think there’s a certain responsibility I have to recognize him. He was such an artist. That guy changed my life,” he recalled. “I was rolling from gig to gig as a kid. I didn’t give a s**t. I felt like it was never going to end, I was never going to grow up, and I was going to play this kid role forever. Well, I did The Hitcher, and it changed everything. I didn’t know about thinking outside of the box.” //“I was taught that you do what the script says, you don’t bring ideas, but here was this guy poking pennies in my eyes in cafes, and I was like, ‘What the f*** are you doing?’ but I decided to just go with it. In one scene, he’s supposed to give me a handful of bullets, but he handed me a handful of rocks with a bullet. He’d do stuff like that. I was 17, and it changed me. I’ll never forget how everybody else on set was petrified of him.” //Howell recalled an encounter with his co-star, who died in 2019, which later proved vital in his career. //“Rutger ate alone in his trailer every single day. Nobody would talk to him apart from perhaps the director if his back was against the wall and he had to give him a direction. Finally, he invites me to have lunch with him. I’m sitting there, and it is deathly quiet. Rutger’s smoking his filterless Camel cigarette while he’s picking through his fruit salad. My knees are knocking, and I’m there eating, trying to finish my meal and get out of there. Finally, I muster up a little small talk. Everybody’s been talking about Blade Runner and his other movies, and how nobody plays the villain better than him, but I just looked at him, and with my squeaky, petrified voice, I was like, ‘So, Rutger, everybody says you’re an amazing bad guy so why do you play bad guys so well?’ What felt like an eternity went by as he just finished that final drag on that cigarette, and he hissed at me in that guts deep whisper, ‘I don’t play bad guys,’ and didn’t say another frickin word. I didn’t know what to do. I think I inhaled the rest of my food and started to back out of the trailer. That rattled the around my head for a long, long time.” //Howell concluded, “Finally, when I was about 40 years old, I did a role on Criminal Minds, The Reaper, and that was my opportunity to play this “bad guy.” I recalled that experience with Rutger, and it hit me. I realized what he meant. He never approached work as the villain as somebody playing bad. That’s why Rutger’s work was filled with humanity. I can’t tell you how many times, because of that application of what he told me, people come up to me on the street and want to talk to me about it, more than probably any other project, including The Outsiders, more than E.T., more than anything I have done. Rutger was the king of that, and it took me 23 years to understand what he meant but thank God he gave me that bit of advice when he did because it changed my career.”//Reagan is due to be released in early 2022.//", 13.0%

The missing piece, as Scarbrough explains, is civility. Galvanized by her experience as an aide to President Ronald Reagan, civility was at the forefront of her work, hosting foreign dignitaries and heads of state on official visits, ensuring all accommodations were made.//The culmination of those experiences and a lifelong commitment to her own civility practice, Scarbrough’s book reclaims civility for the modern age, positioning civility as much more than good manners, but rather an act of mindfulness that must be undertaken every day, in every interaction.//In Scarbrough’s view, civility is interwoven with humanity – that the work of a civility practice is a journey, not a destination. In the same way a golfer never stops working on their game, a civility practice as detailed in Civility Rules! is something that individuals can sharpen and improve. Her book shows readers how the deliberate practice of courtesy, humility, empathy, patience, respect, and understanding can help individuals communicate in a more meaningful way, and ultimately create a more civil world.//“My immediate goal is to share how we can build a practice of civility in our own lives. With practice, patience, and prioritization, we can make positive change, one interaction at a time,” Scarbrough said.//Civility Rules! is available on Amazon

[+] Trump's final campaign event on November 7, 2016, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. (Photo credit should read JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP via Getty Images)//In a new book, Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief Gerald Seib traces the conservative movement from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump and concludes nobody should be surprised Trump took over the Republican Party. Seib’s book, We Should Have Seen It Coming: From Reagan to Trump – A Front-Row Seat to a Political Revolution, is invaluable to understanding the Republican Party’s change from Reagan to Trump. It is also important to anyone who wants to know where the GOP is headed next.//Donald Trump renounced Ronald Reagan’s core principles on trade, immigration and government’s role in the economy. Gerald Seib lays this out in detail.//Trade: While not 100% consistent during his time in office, Ronald Reagan, like the vast majority of conservatives and Republicans, believed in free trade as superior to government overruling the choices of companies and consumers in the free market. Trump has a different view. He has raised tariffs to such an extent that economists have dusted off arguments against tariffs not used in decades.//“Nor did Trump share conservatives’ devotion to free trade,” writes Seib. “He was utterly disdainful of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a trade pact with Canada and Mexico that was the culmination of a dream Reagan laid out when he called for a North American accord in that same 1980 campaign. Trump openly praised tariffs as a tool in trade wars – even calling himself ‘Tariff Man’ at one point – while conservatives disdained tariffs as a form of taxation paid by regular citizens.”//The Free Market: “Conservatives believed in the magic of a free market unconstrained by government interference, while Trump openly tried to pressure and coerce private companies to act as he thought they should,” writes Seib.//Seib notes some Republicans and conservative intellectuals have attempted to reconcile various populist nationalist elements to argue for an industrial policy to preserve factory jobs. “It’s interesting that you can even have a debate about industrial policy in the Republican Party now, because the very term, the very idea, was considered beyond the pale to a lot of conservatives 20 years ago,” said Seib in an interview. He noted Republicans used to be opposed to government interference with free markets. “Clearly a lot of the Republican Party has now moved beyond that.”//Immigration: “Most conservatives were scornful of Trump,” according to Seib. “He certainly didn’t share a Reaganesque belief in the virtues of immigration. When Reagan launched his general-election campaign in 1980, he did so with a speech in front of the Statue of Liberty in which he praised generations of immigrants for the work they did in building the United States: ‘They brought with them courage, ambition, and the values of family, neighborhood, work, peace and freedom. We all came from different lands, but we share the same values, the same dream.’ When Trump launched his campaign, he did it a few miles away, in his eponymous Fifth Avenue skyscraper, with a speech in which he called Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers.”//“Reagan carried out of office the same simple but clear definition of conservatism that he carried in,” writes Seib. “This was true, in a particularly striking way, with immigration. Reagan believed in immigration as a life force that gave new vitality to America, and he rhapsodized about that belief regularly. He held to a particular view of immigration as part of the American Dream, and immigrants as part of the American fabric.”//In contrast, by 2021, Donald Trump will have reduced legal immigration by 49% since becoming president – without any change in U.S. immigration law, according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis. An April presidential proclamation blocked the entry of legal immigrants to the United States in almost all categories. A presidential proclamation, issued by Trump on June 22, 2020, suspended the entry of foreign nationals on H-1B, L-1 and certain other temporary visas.//How Did Trump Take Over the Republican Party?: “It was a trend that was developing slowly over time,” said Seib. “It didn’t start with Donald Trump. He didn’t come as a bolt out of the blue. There was an open door for a populist nationalist message and he just walked through the open door.” //Seib points out the Republican Party changed at the grassroots. It became over time a party that had a different demographic makeup, a lot of working-class Americans in the center of the country. “Many over time became Republicans in many cases for cultural reasons,” said Seib. “They didn’t like the Democratic Party’s drift on abortion, prayer in schools. They became the foot soldiers of the Republican Party, but realized they weren’t really satisfied with the economic message of the Republican Party, particularly on trade and immigration. I think the change was developing as far back as Patrick Buchanan in the 1990s. Trump was the one candidate in 2016 who understood that and took advantage of it.”//What Comes Next on Trade and Immigration?: “If Trump wins reelection, I think you can be assured of more of the same,” said Seib. “He has an impulse and instinct on trade and on immigration that isn’t going to change. On trade, he has walked up to the edge of a full-blown trade war with China but never quite crossed that line. I think he’ll have brinksmanship with the Chinese on trade, a continuing use of tariffs. You’ll probably have continuing crackdowns, particularly on illegal immigration, but also, and I think this is underappreciated by people, on legal immigration. I suspect there will be more pressure in a second Trump term from the business community to adopt a more nuanced view of immigration and maybe that will have some effect, but I suspect overall what you see is what you would get.”//What If Trump Loses?: “If Trump loses the election, I think you will have a period of an important internal debate in the Republican Party about what it stands for and which direction it’s going,” said Seib. He points out Republicans started that debate after the 2012 election. “Was it going to move in an establishment direction, one that said, ‘Let’s have a bigger tent, let’s be more accommodating of Hispanics, let’s broaden our appeal and have a more welcoming message on immigration and Dreamers.’ Or ‘Let’s go in a nationalist populist direction.’ Donald Trump took them down the fork of the road that said populism and nationalism. That debate would be resumed.”//", 11.3%

(Photo by Angela Weiss/Getty Images)//Charlie Robinson, a fixture on long-running NBC comedy Night Court, died Sunday at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center from cardiac arrest with multi-system organ failures due to septic shock and metastatic adenocarcinoma. He was 75.//Born on November 9, 1945 in Houston,  Robinson began as a young actor in the 1960s as a member of the Actors Studio. As a teenager, he was a singer with the group Archie Bell and the Drells, and later with a group called Southern Clouds of Joy.//On television, Robinson began making the rounds as a guest star on a roster of series in the 1970s that included Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law, Caribe, Cannon, The White Shadow and Lou Grant. Earlier in his career, in 1971, he also had a role on the big screen in Jack Nicholson's directorial debut Drive, He Said.//Prior to Night Court, Robinson was a regular on two short-lived TV series: drama Flamingo Road in 1981, and sitcom Buffalo Bill opposite Dabney Coleman from 1983 to 1984. He also guest-starred in Hill Street Blues and Hotel prior to beginning his nine season stint as Mac Robinson, a Vietnam war veteran and the court clerk at the Manhattan Criminal Court on Night Court in 1984.//Following Night Court, Robinson appeared as a regular in five additional TV series — comedies Love & War, Ink and The Guest Book; and dramas Buddy Faro and Hart of Dixie — but none would have the durability of Night Court. Additionally, Robinson made multiple appearances on comedies Home Improvement and Mom. He appeared in many other television shows including House, My Wife and Kids, Charmed, How I Met Your Mother and This Is Us. And he had an active career on the stage, winning several awards including the Best Actor Ovation Award for his performance as Troy Maxson in August Wilson's Fences.//Robinson is survived by his wife Dolorita, his children Luca, Charlie, Christian, and Byron, as well as grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.//", 11.6%

Classes at all of Chicago public schools have been canceled today by the school district after the teacher's union voted to return to virtual learning citing unsafe conditions in the schools as the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus continues to spread. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)//The Chicago Teachers Union’s abandonment of their duties today is nothing short of a strike.//It’s an action that ignores both science and experience. And in the Chicago Mayor’s opinion, it is illegal. Despite the $1.5 billion that Chicago had to prepare for precisely this moment, they were sadly less than ready.  Both the union and the administration should be dismissed. As stated when the Chicago Teachers Union similarly abandoned the city’s children in early 2021, the Mayor would do well to study former President Ronald Reagan’s actions during the 1981 air traffic controllers strike. He offered them 48 hours to return to work or be fired.//Why the hard line? When Covid’s first, more powerful and deadly strain hit, responsible and effective educators everywhere worked tirelessly to return to in-person learning, including the Chicago Catholic School system which opened long before the city’s public schools did and remained open. //And today, the threat of Covid is understood to be much less severe for schools and students. Reports the New York Times’ David Leonhardt, ”data now suggest that many changes to school routines are of questionable value in controlling the virus’s spread. Some researchers are skeptical that school closures reduce Covid cases in most instances. Other interventions, like forcing students to sit apart from their friends at lunch, may also have little benefit…One reason: Severe versions of Covid, including long Covid, are extremely rare in children. For them, the virus resembles a typical flu. Children face more risk from car rides than Covid.”//It’s the equivalent of calling a snow day when it’s raining, and then insisting that until the rain goes away they won’t return. In any other industry, such actions cost you your job.//Within five days of the first signs of the pandemic, Partnership Schools, a Catholic Schools network serving about 2,300 students across nine schools in New York City and Cleveland, was up-and-running a hybrid education model, with teachers adapting during the shutdowns to community and families’ needs as necessary. //Zeta Charter Schools was the first elementary school to reopen in New York City following the first wave of the virus shutdowns, offering in-person instruction, and serving over 50% of students in person full time, five days per week without losing a single instructional day. //Kids have learned throughout the pandemic at the Discovery Center of Springfield, MO, recent winners ... [+] of the $1 million STOP Award for transformative education.//In Springfield MO, a museum, The Discovery Center, converted to a school within five days rather than let kids go without education.   //Another example of the tenacity of great educators is Louisiana Key Academy who had a plan in place within three weeks of the first outbreak, with the necessary resources and training in place to carry out live, small group virtual instruction. By July of 2020, they were the first school to reopen in the state. //The Dallas Independent School District has become innovative in the face of increasing health challenges. Not only did the Dallas Education Foundation create its first hybrid education model when the pandemic struck, it deployed sophisticated technology to ensure all students had access to learning. Today, Superintendent Michael Hinojosa has said virtual learning will be the absolute last resort for the 147,000-plus diverse student district.//These are but a few of the examples of education providers who did not walk out on their responsibilities, knowing that both adults and kids can be safe if schools follow basic protocols.//Teachers unions and the large school districts do not respect science anymore. And rather than copy the successful education approaches of thousands of schools across the country, they remain impervious to children’s educational needs and parent demands. Policymakers must hold them accountable and be willing to take bold action. They should follow Arizona Governor Doug Ducey’s lead. This week he announced that every parent would be given $7,000 as part of the “open for learning” program, if their schools are closed to them. //In a world where disruption is going to be the new normal for education, there cannot be the same tired response by outdated bureaucracies and unions unconcerned with not just the educational but the mental, emotional and physical well being of the nation’s children.  It is time for education innovators to be the driving force of change backed by a large and vocal body of parents everywhere and let it start with wholesale changes in Chicago. Parents need to not only vote those who would stay with a 19th century game plan out of office, but should put their names on ballots. It is the ultimate solution.//", 5.4%
"Bob Mould On Channeling Past Frustrations For New Album ‘Blue Hearts’ And Drawing Parallels Between Reagan And Trump", "MILAN, ITALY - OCTOBER 14: American musician Bob Mould, also guitarist and singer-songwriter for ... [+] alternative rock band Hüsker Dü, performs on stage on October 14, 2016 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Sergione Infuso/Corbis via Getty Images)//MILAN, ITALY - OCTOBER 14: American musician Bob Mould, also guitarist and singer-songwriter for ... [+] alternative rock band Hüsker Dü, performs on stage on October 14, 2016 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Sergione Infuso/Corbis via Getty Images)//In February of 2019, following a period spent living in Berlin, Bob Mould released one of his most optimistic albums, Sunshine Rock, an uncharacteristically positive studio effort which followed a pair of records informed by the loss of each parent.//During the writing of that album in 2018, the songwriter and guitarist penned a song which was particularly direct in its address of the hypocrisy and division he observed, in a moment of déjà vu, to be quickly coming to define the American experience: “American Crisis.” //Coming of age in the 80s as a member of Minnesota punk trio Hüsker Dü, Mould’s career has often been marked by songs featuring a spirited response to the world. And yet “American Crisis” stood out.//For the most part, Sunshine Rock was an apolitical affair. So Mould kept “American Crisis” on the back burner. //Continuing the rare look back on his career that began with his 2011 autobiography, he began work on Distortion, a massive box set containing 8 LPs or 24 CDs. Featuring reimagined artwork and more, the new set, scheduled for release on October 23, chronicles Mould’s post-Hüsker Dü work both solo and via 90s alternative power trio Sugar.//As part of that retrospection, he couldn’t help but think about the way Hüsker Dü functioned in the 80s during the Reagan administration, drawing parallels between the Reagan and Trump presidencies. The HIV/AIDS epidemic sprung up on Reagan’s watch just as the COVID-19 pandemic did on Trump’s, both to arguably questionable response. Both administrations have also been accused of marginalizing certain groups. //Mould took a look back at himself as a younger man, recalling his approach to the world during what he deemed to be similar times, channeling that frustration. It’s an introspective process that’s resulted in the direct approach to the world that defines “American Crisis” and the other thirteen tracks on his fourteenth studio album Blue Hearts, now available via Merge Records.//“With the autobiography, it was three years of rehashing my past - reliving my life in a way. And I knew that there would be an element of that with the Distortion box. But I didn’t realize that it would become so pronounced the deeper that I got into the production of the box set. The memories of the characters, the places, everything just started coming back to life in pretty vibrant detail,” said Mould over the phone earlier this month. “With the new album, I would love to be out there screaming at the top of my lungs - but I can’t right now. In an ideal world, this record, Blue Hearts, will be a celebration record when the time is right. As opposed to yet more misery.”//I spoke with Bob Mould about the thoughtful approach to his past work that characterizes Distortion and how that process of looking back came to influence Blue Hearts. A transcript of that conversation, lightly edited for length, follows below. //In the midst of processing the Distortion box set, and looking back, I couldn’t help but think also about Hüsker Dü . And the way Hüsker Dü functioned during the Reagan administration. Did you draw from that experience during the songwriting process for Blue Hearts? Because it feels like there may be some parallels in the world between then and now...//BOB MOULD: Absolutely. //The quick version of how the album came together is this... “American Crisis” was written for Sunshine Rock. So that would’ve been the spring of 2018. I thought it was a little heavy for that album. Sunshine Rock was meant to be this optimistic album. So I kept that song in pocket. //Summer of 2019, I was doing a lot of solo electric shows in Europe - playing a lot of guitar. //Then I think it was around September of 2019, getting this awful sense of déjà vu - where it felt like I had seen where the world was at once before. And it sort of felt like the third year of Reagan: a television movie star propped up by evangelicals. The moral majority. And all of the ugliness that came from that. Including the inability to acknowledge that AIDS was an epidemic for five years. And then sort of looking at the third year of Trump - another television personality propped up by evangelicals. And I was drawing those parallels. //In doing so, I had to consider not so much what Hüsker Dü was but who I was at 22 going on 23. Being in a band getting ready to write a concept album, for lack of a better term, and trying to use whatever meager tools that I had - a guitar, an amp, a voice, a van, a bag of clothes, a sleeping bag - and trying to effect some type of change in the world with nothing but that. //So there was that economy right there. There’s sort of that work ethic of going door-to-door and spreading the word - working inside community to build a new world. And just considering all of that as 58, going on 59, living in Berlin, Germany, it was like, “OK. You’ve got to do something with all of these ideas.” //And that’s what sparked these songs: writing with purpose, writing with an immediacy. Writing a protest record. With the intent that if I couldn’t change the world, at least I could clarify my stance inside my own world with my fans - and make it very clear to them how important these ideas are to me. And if they’ve trusted me for this long, then I hope they trust me for this round.//Then it was taking those songs, those bursts, on the road for two and half weeks in January of 2020 and playing them for people and getting that feedback during the show. And, especially after the show - going out and talking with people and having them say, “What you’re doing is really important. You’ve got to say these things. Keep doing this.” //And then going right into the studio in February and making Blue Hearts in two weeks and having that record done, and mastered and signed off by March 1. And then going into lock down. Where it was like, “Oh. That was the other shoe. I didn’t know it was ready to drop but there it is.” //Greg Norton, Grant Hart and Bob Mould of Husker Du on 10/10/87 in Chicago, Il. (Photo by Paul ... [+] Natkin/WireImage)//When we spoke last year about Sunshine Rock, we got into the idea of addressing the world, addressing politics in song. Can I read you a quote you gave me that day?//Mould: Absolutely…//You said, “I think, in terms of what’s going on in the world at large and within the U.S. government specifically, or how polarized the country is, I think a lot of that is self-evident. And for me to pay a lot of service to it in the work right now, I just wasn’t feeling it. People already know where they stand. For me to spend an entire record railing on a seemingly corrupt government, I don’t know if that’s the best use of my time. And I don’t know that it’s necessary for me to memorialize that which is so blatantly obvious.” A year and a half later, Blue Hearts certainly addresses the world about as directly as you ever have and about as directly as any artist has this year. Was there a tipping point for you where it became particularly important to do that?//Mould: (Laughing) Clearly. Yes. //I think it really goes back to late August, early September 2019, when that ugly déjà vu came over me. It was too strong to deny. It was like, “Yay! I’m in Berlin. I’m done with mourning the loss of my parents on a day-to-day basis. I’ve made a happy record. I got to do orchestras. Now I’m riding my bike 15 miles a day.” And then all of a sudden, boom! It was just like, “What is going on? Why am I not addressing this?” //So, yes. Clearly, I had an enormous about face. I think being in Berlin, I knew how bad things were. But, in September, sort of having that moment, it was time to be angry. //And I needed to look back to history and see who I was the last time this happened. What were my shortcomings then? And what did we do as a country about it? Once I figured those pieces out, I had very little means and very few tools but I was able to get a lot done by doing it a certain way. So, that’s part of the methodology. //Coming back in November of 2019 to San Francisco, and reentering the American media cacophony - where you cannot get away from polarized views… It was like I was back in American news. Because news in Berlin was news. It was informative. It was sort of boring. It wasn’t very titillating. But then, when you come back to America, it’s like, “Oh my god, entertainment… also known as news.” And I was just losing my mind. Because it was just so off the rails. //And I guess in 1983, when I was 22, 23 years old - a little bit self-hating, a little or lot still in the closet so to speak - not doing enough to protest the government’s inactivity toward HIV/AIDS. And, to be fair, it was [writer and activist] Larry Kramer in the late 80s and ACT UP - and that’s when everything galvanized. //But I have my moments and I have my laments where I didn’t maybe say enough or do enough. And, I guess, this time around, I did not want to let another number of years go by in my life and have another similar lament to the situation we are in now as a civilization.//When I first heard “American Crisis” in June, I felt like it spoke to what was happening in the world following the murder of George Floyd so well. I related strongly to the anger in that song. To find out that it was written two years prior was kind of stunning. I feel like I’m experiencing that a lot with music right now. But what’s it like thinking about those lyrics today and the way they pertain to everything that’s happening in America two years later? Because that song might be more applicable today than it was in 2018… //Mould: June 3 was the day that we dropped the song. I think it was very late in May that the George Floyd killing happened. And it was Monday, June 1 where Trump took his teargas to the protesters so that he could walk over to St. John’s and hold a book upside down. You can’t write this stuff.//I did feel that there was a part of me that, selfishly, in my own make-believe world of writing songs, was sort of like, “Why is this happening to me, around me, before me? I don’t even know how to process this.” I felt like I came up with these awful visions two years ago and now it’s reportage or something. All I wanted to do was make a protest record, do a campaign and then tour. //You know what I’m saying. None of this makes sense. There is no right way to do this. How do I talk about myself and my work and my record while being respectful of way bigger issues like Black Lives Matter? Or the truth in general? Or democracy in and of itself? How do I thread this? //It’s all a great unknown, you know?//Earlier, you referenced the tools you had at your disposal. Almost all of them involve touring. Yet here you are releasing a new album like this with the ability to tour off the table indefinitely amidst pandemic. How do you go about ensuring an album like Blue Hearts resonates when you can’t perform it live in front of people?//Mould: Just talk about it as much as possible. With everybody that wants to listen to my story, my history - why I think music can change the world (why it changed my world). And why I tried to build a world with it. The parallels between that world where I was able to have a hand in changing things for a moment. And then me reflecting on that, bringing it forward and trying to update it in the hopes that it makes sense to people. That was the sense of purpose that I went into this endeavor with this year.//It’s been a long time since I made a record that was so built for the stage. And it’s kind of killing me that I can’t get out there and spread the word person-to-person. But there’s a pandemic. I’m the last to go back to work. I have the loudest voice. I can’t go back. So I have to wait. We all have to wait. We all have to do the right thing. //So, it’s really frustrating. I’m watching people try and come up with ways to present live music and none of them resonate like the way I know. So, I’ve been a little hesitant to try any of these new ways. It’s just trying to keep the message alive. Trying to get radio to play it. Trying to get press to write about it. //I’m not a big fan of social media. So, it’s really a challenge for me to use that tool. I guess I view it as part of the problem, not part of the solution. I don’t know. There’s just no critical thinking involved. And that’s frustrating. There’s no setting a stage with historical evidence to tell a story that would bring a reader to a conclusion. //SAN BERNARDINO, CA - OCTOBER 07: Bob Mould performs at Glen Helen Amphitheatre on October 7, 2017 ... [+] in San Bernardino, California. (Photo by Timothy Norris/Getty Images)//Beyond that, to me, one of the things that defines all art forms, not just music, is the idea of truth. Honesty. The honest expression of an idea in a given work. And that’s something that social media tends to marginalize - truth and honesty. But those concepts do lie at the heart of your latest album despite the fact that we live in a world where it’s being devalued on a daily basis - with social media perhaps part of the problem. How important is it to have that concept at the heart of an album like Blue Hearts during times like these?//Mould: I just write what I know. I know that there’s a lot of evil forces at work in the world right now. I worry about the outcome - but I can’t worry about tailoring my work to fit whatever confusing narratives are out there right now. //I’ve done this my whole life. This is all I know. Any currency that I’ve built up that allows me to speak with you, I’ve got to use it now. I can’t keep it for myself and I can’t use it for something else. This is sort of where it goes.//Growing up as a music fan, at a young age as a weird kid, one of the things that I latched onto was the idea that music exposed me to things and sounds and people that were different - and made it OK to be different. Prince and David Bowie come to mind. I think that maybe we need that in the world today more than ever. Is that a role music can play - helping people accept things that look or sound or act differently?//Mould: Yeah. Absolutely. //I think now because music is so ubiquitous that, despite whatever devaluation has happened to the art form because of technology, the good news is that anyone can tap into music. Anyone can make and distribute music. There’s still gatekeepers - obviously. With streaming services, they will tell us what we should be listening to. //But the good news is that places like Bandcamp, for instance, you can go down a rabbit hole and chase down trans artists and remote Asian, African or South American music that you would never come across. The whole world is there to see. //If people can remain active as music fans, and not succumb to that passive intake of playlists that are curated by a computer for you, I think this is an amazing time for music. There’s so many messages and so many types of music and so many cultures being referenced and respected and promoted through music. It’s a great time for that.//But, again, I fear that as we get older, our tendency is to take what we’re given as opposed to going and looking for things.
