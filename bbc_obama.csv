"US Capitol attack: Rioters held dagger to the throat of America - Biden", "President Joe Biden has heavily criticised former President Donald Trump on the first anniversary of the attack on the US Capitol.//President Joe Biden has heavily criticised former President Donald Trump on the first anniversary of the attack on the US Capitol.//In a televised speech Mr Biden accused his predecessor of spreading "a web of lies" that led to the mob's assault. //Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building on 6 January 2021 as Congress gathered to certify Mr Biden's presidential election victory.//Live footage of US politicians cowering from the mob shocked the world.//Mr Trump had urged protesters at a rally outside the White House shortly beforehand to "peacefully" march on Congress, but he also encouraged them to "fight" and stirred up the crowd with unsubstantiated claims of mass voter fraud in the election he had just lost. //Shortly after Mr Biden's speech on Thursday Mr Trump released an angry statement hitting out at his successor. In it, he accused Mr Biden of "failure" and repeated false claims about the election. //What happened to these Capitol rioters?Five big questions about Trump and the riot//Democrat politicians, who have a majority in the US Congress, planned a number of events to mark the one-year anniversary of the attack - including a candlelit vigil outside the Capitol building.//Many spoke about their experiences of the day, including sheltering and hiding from the rioters along with young members of staff.//A House committee is conducting an inquiry, and so far investigators have arrested 725 suspects in connection with the riot. //Mr Biden condemned the attackers and Mr Trump in his speech on Thursday, using some of his strongest language yet about both the Capitol riots and his predecessor.//"Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated this incidence, held a dagger at the throat of America and American democracy", Mr Biden said in Statuary Hall, a section of the Capitol complex that was breached by rioters.//"They came here in rage, not in the service of America, but rather, in the service of one man.//"The former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election... His bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our constitution". //The US leader also warned that the threats to American democracy "have not abated."//Later in the day House Speaker Nancy Pelosi presided over a moment of silence on the chamber floor. She praised police officers who defended lawmakers and other people who were sheltered inside as the riot raged. //"The insurrectionists targeted more than just the building. They targeted democracy itself," she said. //Some Republicans skipped the day's commemorative gatherings. The party's Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, led a delegation to the funeral of a former senator in Atlanta, Georgia. //Meanwhile Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene - two provocative pro-Trump members of the House - held a news conference at the Capitol billed as a "Republican response" to the day's events. //They repeated unsubstantiated theories that the attack was fuelled by federal agents.//The mother of Ashli Babblit, a US Air Force veteran who died after being shot by police while trying to storm the House of Representatives, also spoke outside Congress. //"She was a patriot. She served this country her whole adult life," Micki Witthoeft told the Alabama-based Right Side Broadcasting Network.//Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, in a tweet, accused Mr Biden of "brazen politicisation" of the 6 January riot.  //Last January, Joe Biden gave an inaugural address outside the US Capitol that focused on national healing and unity.//Now, standing in the centre of the building nearly a year later - after it has become clear that the nation is as divided as ever - Biden put unifying rhetoric aside and took dead aim at Donald Trump and his supporters.//In some of the sharpest words directed at his predecessor since the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden condemned Trump's continued efforts to question the legitimacy of that election.//Not only that, he blasted Republicans who continue to stand behind the former president and endorsed national efforts to enact election reform to counter what he said were Trump-backed attempts to undermine voting rights.//This is an election year in America, with control of the US Congress and several key states hanging in the balance.//Biden's rhetorical shift could represent a strategic shift, as well - a decision that the Democratic base can most effectively be rallied with anger, not hope.", 5.0%

But he cancelled the event after aides reportedly warned of negative press coverage.//A spokesman for Mr Trump, Taylor Budowich, said it was "unsurprising" that Mr Biden would spend the day "trying to further divide our nation" in an attempt to distract voters from rising inflation and crime and coronavirus school closures.//President Biden - who rarely mentions his predecessor - will speak on Thursday morning in Statuary Hall, a section of the Capitol complex that was breached by rioters.//The White House press secretary said the president's speech "will lay out the significance of what happened at the Capitol, and the singular responsibility President Trump has for the chaos and carnage that we saw".//"He will forcibly push back on the lies spread by the former president - in an attempt to mislead the American people, and his own supporters, as well as distract from his role in what happened," she added.//"President Biden has been clear-eyed about the threat the former president represents to our democracy," Ms Psaki continued. //House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will preside over a moment of silence at noon on the chamber floor.//An inquiry into the riot is being conducted by a House committee, which is dominated by President Biden's Democrats.//The panel is chasing phone records, visitor logs and other White House documents that could shed light on events leading up to the attack on Congress. They have issued legal summonses to members of Mr Trump's inner circle. //What happened to these Capitol rioters?Five big questions about Trump and the riot//Senior Republicans will mostly be outside of Washington on Thursday, with the party's Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, heading a delegation to the funeral of a former senator in Atlanta, Georgia. Mr McConnell said in the immediate aftermath of the riot that Mr Trump was "practically and morally responsible". //Some Republican lawmakers have portrayed the invasion of Congress, in which rioters engaged in hand-to-hand combat with police, as a peaceful protest that was spoiled by a few troublemakers. //But conservative Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was lambasted on the right on Wednesday after he labelled the riot "a violent terrorist attack".//US Attorney General Merrick Garland gave an update on the FBI inquiry on the eve of the anniversary, calling the law enforcement operation "one of the largest, most complex and most resource-intensive investigations in our history".//"The actions we have taken thus far will not be our last," he said. "We will follow the facts wherever they lead because 6 January was an unprecedented attack on the seat of our democracy."//He said 140 police officers had been assaulted, including one who was beaten and zapped repeatedly with a stun gun until he had a heart attack. //Another screamed for help as rioters crushed him between doors and bludgeoned him with his own weapon, said the attorney general.//Mr Garland is facing pressure from the left to prosecute the rioters more aggressively, as well as charge the former president himself and his allies. //"We build investigations by laying a foundation," Mr Garland said. "We resolve more straightforward cases first because they provide the evidentiary foundation for more complex cases."//Most of the charges so far have been misdemeanours that often entail no jail time in the event of a conviction. //These suspects have been charged with trespassing, disorderly conduct, parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building, and obstructing congressional proceedings.Â //Who stormed the Capitol?Capitol riots timeline: How the day unfolded//But 325 suspects are facing felonies - more serious counts - such as using a dangerous weapon to assault officers.//Mr Garland said 300,000 tips had been submitted by private citizens, and the FBI were still hunting about 2,500 suspects.Â //One rioter, an unarmed woman, Ashli Babbitt, was shot by an officer while trying to breach the House chamber. Two others died from natural causes related to cardiovascular disease and another succumbed to a drug overdose. //Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died a day later of natural causes after suffering two strokes while defending the building, according to medical officials. //In an opinion piece for the New York Times on Wednesday, the oldest-living former US President, Jimmy Carter, warned that the country "now teeters on the brink of a widening abyss". //"Without immediate action, we are at genuine risk of civil conflict and losing our precious democracy. Americans must set aside differences and work together before it is too late."//A week after the riot, Mr Trump was impeached by the House for incitement of insurrection, but acquitted by the Senate, which was then controlled by his fellow Republicans. He is still seen as holding sway over the party.//Of 10 Republicans who sided with Democrats in the lower chamber vote, two have resigned amid death threats, three others are facing Trump-backed election challenges, and four more have kept a low profile. //Wyoming's Liz Cheney was stripped of her Republican leadership position in the House, but is spearheading the congressional inquiry into the Capitol riot.//National divisions over the invasion of Congress are underscored by BBC interviews with American voters. //James Clark, 69, a life-long Republican voter in Virginia, said: "It was truly shocking. President Trump seemed intent on burning down the house before leaving Washington." //But Trump voter Keri Smith, 42, of Texas, argued that the Black Lives Matter protests were worse.//"We've seen stuff crazier than that happening on a weekly basis for the past two years," she said. //Laura Powers, a disaffected Republican, says she is "still horrified" by what she watched on TV that day. //"It was a horrible, dark day for democracy and it should never ever happen again," she said.//The riot has been described as the worst assault on the Capitol since the War of 1812. It is not the only such attack since that era.//In 1983 a female-led communist group bombed the US Senate.

It says it is entitled to move its troops freely on its own soil.//No time for war: Russians see no chance of conflictIs Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? //Although the two sides exchanged warnings during the call, Russian foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters shortly after that Mr Putin was "pleased" with the conversation. He added that it had created a "good backdrop" for future talks.//A senior US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the tone had been "serious and substantive."//"President Biden reiterated that substantive progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of de-escalation," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said.//"He made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine," she added.//US and Russian officials are set to meet for in-person talks in Geneva next month, and the White House said Mr Biden urged his Russian counterpart to pursue a diplomatic solution.//In a holiday message before Thursday's call, Mr Putin told Mr Biden he was "convinced" the pair could work together based on "mutual respect and consideration of each other's national interests".//His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow was "in the mood for a conversation".//"We believe that only through talks is it possible to solve all the immediate problems that we have in abundance between us," Mr Peskov added.//White House officials sound calm when they talk about Ukraine, at least while speaking outside of the West Wing. //The phone call between President Biden and President Putin on Thursday, as a senior administration official told reporters in the early evening, was "a serious, substantive, conversation".//That official spoke in a measured voice about the talks, and sounded even-tempered when he spoke about the threat from Russia.

For now. they are trying to do everything they can to make sure they keep talking into the new year.//Ukraine's defence minister told parliament at the start of December that Russia had massed tens of thousands of troops near the border, and could be gearing up for a large-scale military offensive at the end of January.//Russia has argued the military build-up at the border is a protective measure against Nato, the Western military alliance. It wants legally binding guarantees that Nato will not expand further east, and that certain weapons will not be sent to Ukraine or any neighbouring countries. //The US has rejected what it styles as a Kremlin bid to control the future of independent countries.//Ukraine has not been offered Nato membership, but has close ties with the bloc. //Tensions between Russia and Ukraine are nothing new. In 2014, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and soon after started to back a separatist insurgency in Ukraine's east that has seen some 14,000 people killed in periodic fighting.//Washington and its European allies have warned Russia to expect severe economic sanctions if troops do cross into Ukraine again.

"Covid: US halves isolation time for asymptomatic infection", "US health officials have halved the recommended isolation time for people with asymptomatic Covid-19 from 10 to five days, amid a surge in cases.//US health officials have halved the recommended isolation time for people with asymptomatic Covid-19 from 10 to five days, amid a surge in cases.//The measure is expected to alleviate disruption caused by staff shortages in many areas because of infections.//The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says most transmissions happen in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop.//But experts have criticised the lack of testing requirements to end isolation.//The sharp rise in cases has been fuelled by the Omicron variant of the virus, which is now dominant in the US. Early studies suggest Omicron is more contagious than other variants, although milder. //The growing number of people having to isolate has put pressure on several industries, including air travel, with thousands of flights cancelled during the Christmas holiday.//Leaders of major US airlines were among those calling for the change, as cancellations continued for a fourth day on Tuesday. //The CDC said the new guidance was "motivated by science", and that the isolation must be followed by five days of wearing a mask around others. The announcement came as more than 200,000 daily infections were confirmed in the past two days nationwide. //CDC director Dr Rochelle Walensky said the recommendation "balances what we know about the spread of the virus and the protection provided by vaccination and booster doses".//"These updates ensure people can safely continue their daily lives," Dr Walensky said in a statement.//But there was no recommendation for people to take rapid at-home tests before the end of their isolation periods. Many experts say such tests help to show whether people continue to spread the virus.//Dr Michael Mina, an assistant professor at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, called the lack of such requirement "reckless".//"I absolutely don't want to sit next to someone who turned Positive 5 days ago and hasn't tested [negative]," he said on Twitter.//In England, people are now required to isolate for seven days, instead of 10, with two negative lateral flow tests needed to end their self-isolation - the first no earlier than day six of isolation and a second 24 hours later.//Speaking on CNN, the top US infectious disease expert said the CDC decision would allow people to return to work more quickly, calling it "very prudent" and a "good choice".//"With the sheer volume of new cases that we're having and that we expect to continue with Omicron, one of the things we want to be careful of is that we don't have so many people out," Dr Anthony Fauci, who also serves as President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, said.//Infectiousness is not like a switch. It does not just go on to off. Instead, people with Covid gradually go from a period of peak infectiousness to lower infectiousness.//The most infectious period starts a few days before symptoms develop. This is one of the reasons why the virus is so hard to contain. After about five days, the risk of passing on the virus will start to decline for most people.//But it is still possible to pass on the virus. That is why when countries started introducing isolation periods many went for 14 days. It was a belt-and-braces approach. But over time these isolation periods have been reduced, reflecting the reduced threat the virus presents as vaccines have been rolled out.//In England it has now been set at seven days if you are negative using a rapid test. That should give people a good idea if they have passed peak infectiousness and reflects the fact the UK has made these rapid tests easily accessible to everyone.//The US approach for people without symptoms is grounded in research that suggests these cases are likely to be less infectious to start with. At the end of the day, it is all about balancing the risks - from both the virus and our responses to it.//The CDC also shortened the quarantine period for people exposed to someone infected. Unvaccinated people will be required to quarantine for five days after exposure, down from 14.//The same applies to people who were more than six months on from their second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or two months after a Johnson & Johnson dose, and had not yet received a booster shot.//Last week, the CDC reduced the recommended isolation time for asymptomatic health workers from 10 to seven days. But they were required to take a test to end their isolation period.//While the new recommendations are not mandatory, they are closely followed by many businesses and policymakers across the US.//EXPLAINER: Omicron up to 70% less likely to need hospital careIN CHARTS: Tracking the pandemic//On Monday, President Biden pledged to deal with a shortage of tests as Omicron threatens to overwhelm hospitals.//"Seeing how tough it was for some folks to get a test this weekend shows that we have more work to do," he said as he joined a call with the administration's Covid response team and state governors. "It's clearly not enough."//New steps will include improving at-home test manufacturing and making it easier to use Google to locate nearby test centres, he said.//Different states and local authorities in the US are introducing new measures in a bid to combat rising cases. New vaccine requirements have come into force in New York City, including a vaccine mandate for private-sector workers in the city. ", 4.5%

It would be mostly paid for by raising  taxes on the wealthy and corporations. // It passed the House of Representatives last month following a vote that largely fell along party lines, but was expected to face significant hurdles in the Senate. //Republicans say the legislation will fuel inflation and damage the economy.//On Sunday, the Democratic West Virginia senator said he had "worked as diligently as possible... to determine the best path forward despite my serious reservations".//"My Democratic colleagues in Washington are determined to dramatically reshape our society in a way that leaves our country even more vulnerable to the threats we face.//"I cannot take that risk with a staggering debt of more than $29tn and inflation taxes that are real and harmful to every hard-working American at the gasoline pumps, grocery stores and utility bills with no end in sight," Mr Manchin said.//The White House said Mr Manchin's comments marked a "breach of his commitments" to Mr Biden as well as his Democratic colleagues in Congress.//"We will continue to press him to see if he will reverse his position yet again, to honor his prior commitments and be true to his word," it said. //"The fight for Build Back Better is too important to give up.

He died from his injuries about three weeks after the attack. //"No soldier is going to be left behind on his watch," Mr Biden said at a White House ceremony on Thursday.//"A soldier's soldier, a warrior who literally walked through fire for his troops," he said, as Sgt Cashe's wife and children looked on from the audience. //Rules require that soldiers be nominated within five years of their brave action, but last year Congress passed a waiver in order for Sgt Cashe to receive the award. It came after years of soldiers and family members advocating for his Silver Star medal to be upgraded.//According to the Washington Post, former President Donald Trump was going to award the Medal of Honor to Sgt Cashe before he left the White House in January, but that plan was scuppered amid safety concerns after Trump supporters rioted at the US Capitol.//Mr Biden also gave the Medal of Honor to Green Beret Sgt Earl Plumlee, 41, for his role in repelling an attack on his base in Afghanistan's Ghazni province in 2013. //After insurgents exploded a truck bomb outside his military post, creating a breach for suicide bombers and rifle-wielding attackers to pour in, he and other troops mounted a defence of their wounded troops by driving into enemy fire.//"Without cover and with complete disregard for his own safety, he advanced on the superior enemy force engaging multiple insurgents with only his pistol," according to the White House memo outlining his gallantry.//Sgt Plumlee was thrown off his feet by multiple suicide bomb blasts, but suffered only light injuries. //"I still don't know why they weren't able to hit me," he told the Washington Post. //Army Ranger Sgt Christopher Celiz died in Afghanistan's Paktia Province in 2018 while he was helping a medical helicopter transport casualties under fire. //After a large group of insurgents attacked his unit, he ran into the hail of bullets to retrieve a heavy weapons system and retake the initiative in the fight, according to the White House. //As the helicopter was preparing to depart, he used his body as a barrier to protect the aircraft's occupants from being hit. As it lifted off, he was hit by enemy fire, but gestured to his fellow troops to keep going without him. //"He knew he was hit, but he waved for the air crew to depart without him," Mr Biden said.

We've had tornadoes that have been the same length as this tornado but we've never had one with the width of this tornado," he said.//Forty people have been rescued from the collapsed candle factory in Mayfield but 60 more remain missing and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, who has visited the scene, said it was unlikely there were more survivors.//He said no-one had been found alive since Saturday.//"There's at least 15ft of metal with cars on top of it, barrels of corrosive chemicals that are there. It'll be a miracle if anybody else is found alive in it," he said.//One candle factory employee made a desperate plea for help on Facebook from under the wreckage as co-workers could be heard moaning in the background.//"We are trapped, please, y'all, get us some help," said Kyanna Parsons-Perez - who was later rescued - in the broadcast played on CNN.//Ivy Williams, whose wife was working a night shift at the factory, was speaking to her on the phone when the call cut out, he told the Washington Post.
