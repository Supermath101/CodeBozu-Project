"What are famous politicians' favourite TV shows and why do they tell us?", "Dive into the Westminster bubble of UK politics or Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC and rolling TV news will never be far away (just ask Malcolm Tucker or Josh Lyman).//Dive into the Westminster bubble of UK politics or Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC and rolling TV news will never be far away (just ask Malcolm Tucker or Josh Lyman).//But politicians also like to remind voters that they do, in fact, have a life outside politics (honest), and prove it to us by revealing what shows they've been watching out of hours - for better or worse.//UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has become the latest MP to reveal his viewing habits, telling this month's edition of The Radio Times that he spent "a lot of time" watching Netflix's raunchy adaptation of Bridgerton, as well the streaming service's widely-panned romcom Emily in Paris over the past year. //Who is the Ted Hastings of Westminster?Emily in Paris: Are any of the cliches real?//Mr Sunak went on to add his "tastes are probably not quite the same" as some of his cabinet colleagues. But Esther Webber, senior UK correspondent at Politico, says this attempt to stand out is far from accidental.  //"By talking about their favourite TV shows, like bands or football teams, politicians are probably trying to give off the impression they're just like us," she says.//"In reality I doubt many leaders get much time to sit down in front of a box set. Notably the programmes they do pick are often pretty safe, critically acclaimed and/or middle of the road."//Webber adds that Mr Sunak, who she says is known for his slick image, "may have actually given himself an edge by leaning into his trashy tastes and going for Emily in Paris - just as he did last year when he named songs by Michael Buble and Mariah Carey as his favourite Christmas tunes." //In light of his admission, we've rounded up the TV shows enjoyed by high-profile politicians from across the political spectrum on both sides of the pond...//Like Mr Sunak, Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary, herself a former presidential candidate, found themselves gripped by Bridgerton. //In an interview with the show's executive producer, Shonda Rhimes, for his Why Am I Telling You This? podcast, Mr Clinton said he and Hillary had binged on the period drama so intensely that "the sun was coming up Sunday morning when we finished it".//He also discussed his wife's reaction to British-Zimbabwean actor RegÃ©-Jean Page, an instant heartthrob in his leading role as Simon, the Duke of Hastings - an eligible but rebellious young bachelor in the show's alternative telling of Regency era London's debutante balls.//"Hillary just kept saying over and over again all night long, 'That's the most beautiful man I ever saw on television', said Mr Clinton. "I kept wanting him to get bumped off after a while."//Speaking to BBC Arts correspondent Rebecca Jones about the actor's departure, Mr Clinton added: "I thought he was great. I thought it was a masterpiece but things change, lives change, people can't do it any more. All kinds of things happen."//Beyond Bridgerton, one Rhimes-produced show Mr Clinton will have perhaps watched alone is political drama Scandal. //Back in 2013, its star Kerry Washington told Entertainment Weekly the former president had outed himself as a fan - much to her surprise.//The role saw her play White House aide turned crisis consultant Olivia Pope who has an affair with the president. //Her character is based on Judy Smith, a DC crisis manager and former deputy press secretary to President George HW Bush, whose high-profile client list included Monica Lewinsky - the White House intern Mr Clinton admitted to having an extra-marital affair with while in office.//The ardent Brexiteer said he was too busy to watch TV when asked about his viewing habits in the run up to the 2015 UK general election.//However, Mr Farage's wife Kirsten told The Telegraph in 2014: "We honestly don't watch a lot of telly but he loves Dad's Army, he loves all the 70s stuff that they still repeat."//Broadchurch and Homeland were Mr Miliband's favourite TV programmes ahead of the 2015 general election. However, he admitted that if his kids were awake, the whole family would often find themselves watching The Octonauts on CBeebies.//Settle down to watch TV with the Cameron household after dinner and it seems you may well end up hiding behind the sofa. //Mr Cameron has previously said he enjoys gritty dramas and murder mysteries such as The Killing, Case Histories, Midsomer Murders and Silent Witness, while also being partial to an episode of Shameless and Breaking Bad.//But sometimes, likely when in need of light relief, Mr Cameron said he enjoyed turning to BBC sitcom Gavin and Stacey (despite listing the 1970s classic Porridge as his all-time favourite).//"There's no doubt in my mind that Wales has produced the finest sitcom to come out in the last five years: of course, Gavin & Stacey," he said in 2012, after meeting one of the show's Welsh stars, Stacey actress Joanna Page, at Downing Street.//"I think we have some of the cast here tonight, have we? Very good. Well, it's tidy to have you here," he later joked.//As prime minister Mr Cameron took a keen interest in UK TV - personally lobbying for lengthier series of hit shows.//Scotland's first minister is a long-standing fan of Danish political drama, Borgen.//The show, which drew huge audiences to BBC Four before ending after three seasons in 2013, followed fictional prime minister Birgitte Nyborg, played by Sidse Babett Knudsen, as she lead a coalition government. //While her career finds success, her marriage fails and her relationship with her children is tested.//Speaking to The Herald ahead of the final series, Ms Sturgeon said it was "without doubt" the "most authentic" political drama she's ever watched, particularly as a high-profile female politician herself.//The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter//"What is nice about Borgen is it portrays this obviously strong, confident, clever and articulate woman, but you also see her human side and the fact that she occasionally has self-doubt, which everyone does.//"It shows politicians in a good light, not as perfect or flawless, [Nyborg] is perfectly capable of deploying the dark arts, but comes across as a decent human being."//She added: "You see her vulnerability, the traumas she goes through in her family life and kicking off her high heels at the end of a busy day. All of that, for women in politics, is something you can kind of relate to."//The pair eventually crossed paths in real life, with Ms Sturgeon, then deputy leader, introducing a special screening of the show at Edinburgh's Filmhouse, where Knudsen was hosting a series of Q&A sessions with loyal Borgen fans.//In true political style, the duo used the opportunity to pose for photos, with the actress gifting Ms Sturgeon a box set of the show.//Life in the Oval Office hot seat likely leaves little time for relaxation, especially during a global pandemic. //But back when serving as vice president to Barack Obama in 2012, Mr Biden admitted he'd caught clips of TLC's Here Comes Honey Boo Boo while flying on Air Force Two.//The show, starring the then seven-year-old beauty queen formally known as Alana Thompson, whose sass on Toddlers and Tiaras made her a household name, had quickly become a reality TV smash.//In an interview on Miami's WMIA radio station, Mr Biden said that while he counted US comedies Modern Family and Parks and Recreation as his favourite shows, his granddaughter told him to keep an eye out for Honey Boo Boo.//"Honey Boo Boo is not top on my list, but I am aware just you know by catching snippets on Air Force Two, [she's] quite a phenomenon," he said.//Given how Mrs May's penchant for dancing regularly shone through during her premiership - including at the Conservative Party Conference - perhaps it is unsurprising that she came out as a vocal fan of BBC talent show Strictly Come Dancing.//After her 'Maybot' move became a viral sensation when she debuted it to a group of scouts during a trip to Kenya, the former home secretary offered to give dance "tips" to the latest batch of Strictly constants in 2018.//The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter//Her love for the show even seeped into wrangling over plans for a televised debate over Brexit negotiations. When then Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn rejected BBC proposals, cheekily suggesting on This Morning that he would prefer it to run on ITV so he could watch I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! straight afterwards, Mrs May said she would not appear on ITV for the debate because she, in turn, would miss Strictly.//"I'm keen to have a head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn," Mrs May told This Morning. "I hope this goes throughâ¦ he said he wanted to be on ITV so he could watch the final of I'm a Celebrity.//"I think his proposal meant that I would miss Strictly. I hate to say this on ITV but I'm a bit of a Strictly fan."//In reality, there were also disagreements over the format of the debate and what other parties would take part. //The head-to-head debate was eventually called off as a result of the stalemate.//Mr Trump's avid consumption and often lacerating criticism of TV news became a hallmark of his infamous Twitter feed.//But as much a television personality as a politician, Mr Trump had made a string of TV appearances - most notably as the host of The Apprentice in the US - before his successful White House bid in 2016.//Always full of brash confidence, he told People magazine in 2015 that his "guilty pleasure" TV was literally watching himself during an appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).//"[It] got great ratings. The best ratings in years. It was a terrific success. I enjoyed doing it," he said, before claiming it got substantially more viewers than Mrs Clinton's episode.//However, his love for SNL did not last long as president, following a series of sketches parodying his administration.//As a challenger for the Republican presidential ticket ahead of the 2016 election, Mr Cruz initially denounced Trump before throwing his support behind him, even over his baseless claims of fraud after the 2020 election.//Mr Cruz's TV choices could be said to reflect the cut and thrust of politics - speaking to People magazine for the same article as Trump in 2015, he named Game of Thrones and US political satire Veep as two of his favourite shows. //Beyond escaping into fantasy and comedy, as a Harvard Law School graduate he also revealed he enjoyed Criminal Minds, and, like Mr Cameron, Breaking Bad. //Since leaving office in 2017, Mr Obama has published an annual culture list - including his standouts across TV, film, music and literature. Together with wife Michelle, he has even launched a TV production company, Higher Ground productions, that helped support Oscar-nominated documentary Crip Camp. //The list for 2020 included Netflix's chess drama The Queen's Gambit, starring Anya Taylor-Joy, as well as British actor, writer and comedian Michaela Coel's critically acclaimed BBC series I May Destroy You. //Bafta Awards honour multi-talented Michaela Coel//Mr Obama had also previously commended BBC comedy Fleabag - sparking much amusement given that its star and creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge is caught finding her own pleasure in the former president's speech-making abilities during one episode.//Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"Who truly was the most dishonest president?", "Former President Donald Trump was often accused of having a complete disregard for the truth. Yet some of his predecessors' falsehoods ranged from the bizarre to the horrifying. So how does Trump truly compare?//Former President Donald Trump was often accused of having a complete disregard for the truth. Yet some of his predecessors' falsehoods ranged from the bizarre to the horrifying. So how does Trump truly compare?//When Saddam Hussein invaded the oil-rich emirate of Kuwait in August 1990, President George HW Bush snarled: "This will not stand."//But as US troops were scrambled to the Gulf, the American public was dubious about the justification for military action.//The Kuwaiti government-in-exile promptly hired a US public relations firm, Hill & Knowlton, whose Washington DC office was run by Bush's former chief of staff.//The PR firm coached a purported witness, introduced as a 15-year-old girl called "Nayirah", to tearfully tell US congressmen in October 1990 that Iraqi soldiers had entered a hospital in Kuwait, removed babies from incubators and left them to die on the cold floor.//Nayirah, reporters were assured, was using an assumed name for fear of reprisals against her family back home.//Only after the war would it emerge she was the daughter of Kuwait's ambassador to the US. And her story was completely baseless, as John MacArthur details in his book, Second Front, Censorship and Propaganda in the 1991 Gulf War.//Bush is recorded as having publicly touted this tall tale at least six times as he blew the bugle of war.//"Babies pulled from incubators and scattered like firewood across the floor," the president said on one occasion during a speech to US troops in Saudi Arabia.//MacArthur writes that the hoax helped rally the American people behind calls for military action.//In January 1991, Bush's war resolution narrowly passed the Senate. Six senators cited the incubators story as justification for authorising the conflict, notes MacArthur. //Operation Desert Storm launched days later.//The irony is that it seems babies actually did perish after being removed from incubators during Gulf War One. Only it reportedly happened in a massive US-led allied air raid. //On the first night of bombing, as electricity failed amid the explosions, panicking mothers took their newborns from the machines at a paediatric hospital in Baghdad and sheltered in a cold basement where more than 40 of the infants died, according to a contemporary New York Times report.//They were among thousands of civilians estimated killed in the 42-day conflict.//While it has never been established that Bush knew the incubators story he repeatedly told was unfounded, the White House is generally expected to verify claims made by the president - especially one so horrifying. //American journalists failed to debunk the Nayirah testimony until after the war. The controversy was omitted from a recent admiring biography of Bush, and from glowing coverage of his presidency when he died in 2018.//Allegations of presidential dishonesty, however, greatly exercised media fact-checkers during the tenure of Mr Trump.//The Washington Post maintains a database of Trump statements - over 30,000 of them - that it claims are false or misleading.//Many of these utterances, such as about golf or his wealth or whether it snowed at one of his rallies, sound relatively trifling.//Others, such as claims he deliberately misled the American people about the severity of coronavirus, or his unfounded assertions that the 2020 White House election was rigged, would be much more damaging.//Benjamin Ginsberg, author of The American Lie: Government by the People and Other Political Fables, says that when it comes to presidential falsehoods, some are much more consequential than others.//Did Trump's words at rally incite the riot?The link between Monica Lewinsky and Donald Trump//He cites deceptive statements by Bush's son, President George W Bush, as he sold a sequel war on Iraq to the US public.//These included downplaying intelligence doubts that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, and implying he might even have a nuclear weapon, and asserting he was an ally of al-Qaeda.//Prof Ginsberg says "whoppers" that lead to military action are the most harmful of all, and that Trump is not as blame-worthy as some of his predecessors in this respect.//The political science lecturer at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore adds: "The problem is the American presidential selection process is fundamentally flawed and produces monsters. //"It requires years of campaigning, and only the most arrogant, ambitious and narcissistic individuals would possibly be willing to do such a thing."//Once upon a time Americans placed an almost childlike trust in their commanders-in-chief. //They were venerated as demigods.//When did it change?//Many historians date this rupture to Lyndon Baines Johnson, though he was far from the first president to deceive.//JFK's brother, Robert Kennedy, once said of LBJ: "He just lies continually about everything. He lies even when he doesn't have to lie."//Johnson's falsehoods on the Vietnam War included using an August 1964 naval attack that never happened in the Gulf of Tonkin to dramatically escalate the conflict.//"We are not about to send American boys nine or 10 thousand miles away from home to do what Asian boys ought to be doing for themselves," he told voters two months later in Akron, Ohio.//After being elected, LBJ quietly sent the first US combat forces to the jungles and rice paddies of the war zone, eventually deploying more than half a million troops.//Johnson's constant dissembling about this foreign policy disaster envenomed American political life and led journalists to coin a euphemistic term about his administration: the credibility gap.//His successor, Richard Nixon, ran for office pledging to bring an "honourable" end to the carnage in Vietnam, before expanding the conflict by secretly carpet-bombing neutral Cambodia. //Yet it was another cover-up - the Watergate scandal, a botched burglary by his henchmen to wiretap their political opponents - that destroyed Nixon's presidency.//American children were once taught to tell the truth with the aid of a morality tale on presidential honesty that was itself untrue.//"I can't tell a lie, Pa," is the well-known line from the story about the young George Washington confessing to his father that he had split his cherry tree with a hatchet. //It was entirely invented by the president's first biographer. //The father of the nation was in fact not above the odd fib himself.//In 1788, he attempted to rewrite history by claiming he had been the strategic visionary behind the victory over the British at Yorktown seven years earlier during the Revolutionary War.//But it was actually his French allies who masterminded the decisive battle in Virginia. //Washington had been stubbornly arguing instead for an attack on New York City, as Ron Chernow notes in his 2010 biography of the first US commander-in-chief.//Here was the original sin, if you will, of presidential duplicity.//Some lies told by occupants of the White House have been utterly bizarre.//The Bush dynasty - the modern KennedysA child of 9/11 who won't be pressured to voteGeorge HW Bush: The making of a president//Thomas Jefferson told a European naturalist who had disparaged the New World's fauna that woolly mammoths roamed the unexplored American West.//In 1983, President Ronald Reagan claimed he had filmed the atrocities of the Nazi death camps while serving as a US Army Signal Corps photographer in Europe. //He told this story to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir at the White House.//Reagan never left America during World War Two. Few remember this mind-boggling lie. //Many of Trump's comments in the Washington Post catalogue will no doubt prove equally forgettable.//However, one historian argues that the recent tenant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, by the sheer volume of his mendacity, has destroyed the very idea of shared truth in American politics.//"We've tolerated presidential lies ever since the beginning of the republic," says Professor Eric Alterman, author of Lying In State: Why Presidents Lie - And Why Trump Is Worse.//"But Donald Trump is the Frankenstein's monster of a political system that has not merely tolerated lies from our leaders, but has come to demand them."//Prof Alterman says the Capitol rioters, radicalised by conspiracy theories about stolen elections and satanic cabals, underscore the extent to which Trump inspired the "creation of an entire world of unreality".//A useful civics lesson on how a president who has been caught dissimulating reacts away from the cameras may be found in William Jefferson Clinton.//In January 1998 he indignantly denied to reporters having had any sexual relations with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.//But an investigation into whether he had lied under oath heard graphic evidence of their frolics, including that the president used a cigar with her as a sex toy after inviting the 22-year-old into the Oval Office.//Instead of feeling shame for deceiving the nation, Clinton privately expressed relief, according to John F Harris' biography, The Survivor.//Even as he prepared to go on television in August 1998 and express contrition, the president told a close friend: "The lie saved me."//Clinton reasoned that the drip-drip of prurient allegations had allowed the American people to gradually come to terms with his antics, ultimately sparing his political neck.//It's all a rueful reminder of the blessing carved into the mantel of the White House State Dining Room://"May none but Honest and Wise Men ever rule under This Roof."//Follow @judesheerin on Twitter//"If you like your healthcare plan, you'll keep your healthcare plan, period" - Barack Obama in 2013, rated Lie of the Year by PolitiFact"We've removed an ally of al-Qaeda andâ¦ no terrorist network will gain weapons of destruction from the Iraqi regime because the regime is no more" - George W Bush in 2003"A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages.

Everybody has life's pressures and disappointments and terrors, fears or whatever, things I did to manage my anxieties for years."//His relationship with Ms Lewinsky became a major news story in the late 1990s after the then-president first denied the affair before later admitting  to "inappropriate intimate physical contact".//Mr Clinton's initial response to the media reports in 1998 - "I did not have sexual relations with that woman" - has gone down as one of US politics' most memorable quotes.//Lewinsky: Clinton affair an abuse of powerThe link between Monica Lewinsky and Donald Trump//Ms Lewinsky has maintained that her relationship with the former president was consensual but she called it a "gross abuse of power". //"Any 'abuse' came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position..." she told Vanity Fair in 2014.//She said she had "limited understanding of the consequences" at the time and regrets the affair daily. //In the documentary Mr Clinton says he feels "terrible" that Ms Lewinsky's life was defined by their relationship. //"Over the years I've tried to watch her get a normal life back again but you've got to decide how to define normal," he said. //When asked about the incident, Mrs Clinton explained how devastated she was. //"I was so personally, just hurt and I can't believe this, I can't believe you lied.

It's incredible what people can build - and what love can motivate us to build," he wrote. //He looked appropriately in awe as he gazed at the monument - he was one of 4.6 million visitors to it that year.//His next stop was Delhi where he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and spoke to college students at a top university - he told them that India would be crucial to getting "the next billion online".//Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf and his wife, Sebha, visited the Taj in 2001, when Gen Musharraf was in Agra for a historic bilateral summit. //The disputed region of Kashmir - which India and Pakistan have fought over since independence from Britain in 1947 - was one of the subjects of discussion.
