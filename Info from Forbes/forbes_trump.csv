"RNC Wants To Shut Out Presidential Debate Commission Trump Claimed Was Biased", "The Republican National Committee plans to block future presidential candidates from participating in debates organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), it informed the commission Thursday, after former President Donald Trump and his campaign repeatedly claimed CPD was biased against him.//The Republican National Committee plans to block future presidential candidates from participating in debates organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), it informed the commission Thursday, after former President Donald Trump and his campaign repeatedly claimed CPD was biased against him.//Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and then-President Donald Trump at Belmont University on ... [+] October 22, 2020 in Nashville, Tennessee. //RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told CPD in a letter the RNC intends to “prohibit future Republican nominees from participating” in debates sponsored by CPD, a nonpartisan nonprofit that has organized presidential and vice presidential debates since 1987.//The commission’s “failures,” according to the RNC, include not being sufficiently nonpartisan, holding the first debate after early voting had already begun and making “unilateral changes” to debates without informing the candidates.//The charges of partisanship included accusations that CPD’s board members had “publicly disparag[ed]” Trump and that the commission selected moderators the RNC believes are biased toward Democrats.//The RNC proposed a list of reforms it believes the CPD should make, such as establishing codes of conduct and term limits for its board members, but said it’s moving forward with plans to block candidates from participating now because they believe CPD will “delay any reform until it is too late to matter for the 2024 election.”//It’s “unclear” what will happen with future presidential debates if they’re not done through CPD, according to the New York Times, which first reported the RNC’s letter, but it could mean that the candidates and parties would have to negotiate debate terms directly with each other, as they did before the CPD was established.//CPD said in a statement to the Times it “deals directly with” candidates, rather than the parties, and the terms of its 2024 debates “will be based on fairness, neutrality and a firm commitment to help the American public learn about the candidates and the issues.”//Whether the RNC’s plans to distance itself from the commission will actually happen, as the committee’s membership will first have to vote on the proposal at its winter meeting in February. Times journalist Maggie Haberman noted any rule change would be non-binding, and that since candidates organize with the CPD directly, they could simply ignore the RNC’s directive and debate anyway. If it does go into effect, though, the rule could give Trump cover to back out of the debates if he decides to run again in 2024, Haberman pointed out.//Republican candidates have long complained about certain aspects of the CPD-organized debates, the New York Times notes, but the GOP’s opposition to the commission intensified when Trump became the party’s nominee. Trump blasted the commission as a “rigged deal” in 2016 because its co-chair was President Bill Clinton’s former press secretary—even though the other co-chair was the previous head of the RNC—and threatened to sit out the 2020 debates over audio issues and other lingering complaints with the commission’s 2016 matchups. Trump ultimately participated in two of the 2020 debates—but pulled out of another because he deemed the commission’s switch to a virtual format to be “not acceptable”—and his campaign repeatedly blasted CPD for its choice of debate moderators and perceived bias toward now-President Joe Biden’s campaign. “The commission’s pro-Biden antics have turned the entire debate season into a fiasco,” Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien wrote in a letter to the commission on October 19, 2020, referring to it as the “Biden Debate Commission.”//R.N.C.

"It’s Official: Trump Loses ‘Tariff Man’ Crown To Biden, 2021 Data Shows", "President Trump raised tariffs, largely on China, while he was in office and President Biden has ... [+] largely kept them in place.//President Trump raised tariffs, largely on China, while he was in office and President Biden has ... [+] largely kept them in place.//The United States collected more in tariffs in the first 11 months of 2021 than any full year in U.S. history.//That means, as I forecast earlier this year, with only three months of data out, that former President Donald Trump, who gave himself the moniker “Tariff Man” now officially ranks second to President Biden, who has largely left his predecessor's tariffs in place.//Through November, the latest U.S. trade data available about 38% of U.S. trade was an export and 62% ... [+] an import. In recent years, the percentage has been closer to 40-60.//The reason: Imports are up and trade is slightly less balanced.// Tariffs are fees placed on imports from other countries. The oft-stated goal of tariffs is to either reduce trade deficits or to combat what are deemed to be unfair trade practices.//Tariffs, initially the way the United States raised money to pay for its young government, before there was an income tax, are generally frowned upon by economists and the pro-trade community. (I am a member of the second but not the first.)//Economists (and many in the pro-trade community) believe tariffs are actually a hidden tax on consumers, in this case U.S. consumers. The notion is that once the cost to the importer increases, the importer passes that cost along to the retailer, who in turns passes that cost on to the consumer.//I am less convinced. Because there is another option. //Squeeze the manufacturer. Or squeeze the players in the supply chain.//That might explain why, during the Trump Administration, when he could still rightfully crown himself Tariff Man, there was no significant inflation, to the Federal Reserve’s chagrin, even as tariff collections doubled from the last year of his predecessor, Barack Obama.//And, oh yes, imports increased.//The inflation we are experiencing now — the inflation rate released today was the highest since 1982 — is caused by too much money in the economy and too little to spend it on. //I think the economists call that supply and demand.//The “too much money” came from Trump’s decision to send checks to Americans and U.S. businesses in an effort to prevent the economy from going into a tailspin as it was shut down by the then-nascent coronavirus, a well-intentioned plan which in that sense succeeded. //The problem is, this was at the same time that Americans were not able to spend money on restaurants, concerts, hotels and flights. So they bought stuff. Lots of stuff. Lots of imported stuff. Biden largely kept those policies, as well as Trump’s tariffs, in place.//And we expected a different outcome?//If either Trump or Biden had really cared about the U.S. merchandise trade deficit, which is on track to set a record this year — Trump had three record deficits in four years — either one could have told us to save our money.//They could have suggested we save our money, which economists suggest is the only way to cut trade deficits — to increase the savings rate. //But neither Trump nor Biden (thus far) has suggested we stop buying so much stuff, particularly imported stuff like cell phones, computers, TVs, cars and clothes.// So here we are. Imports are up, inflation is up and tariffs are up, way up.//Through November, the United States has collected a record $77.4 billion in tariffs on imports, according to my analysis of just-released U.S. Census data. The December data will be released in early February.//The previous record, set in 2019, was $74.1 billion, as Trump ramped up tariffs on some $300 billion in imports from China in addition to steel tariffs, washing machine tariffs and solar panel tariffs. //During Obama’s last full year in office, the United States collected $34.41 billion in tariffs, or less than half of the top totals by his two successors.//With one month to go, it’s safe to assume the total for all of 2021 will be about $85 billion, even with all those ships stuck out in the Pacific, off the coast of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.//And former President Trump will no longer rightfully be known as Tariff Man. That crown now belongs to President Biden.//", 6.5%

Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) have drawn the most attention, after he told ABC News the 2020 election was “as fair as we have seen” in an interview that aired Sunday.//Trump responded with a statement Monday slamming Rounds, saying, “Is he crazy or just stupid?” and vowing to “never endorse this jerk again.”//Both Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) expressed support for Rounds after Trump’s attack, with Romney tweeting Monday that “Joe Biden won the election” and Cramer telling CNN Tuesday he doesn’t believe the election was stolen and “moved on a long time ago.”//Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) also spoke out against Trump’s claims on Sunday, telling CNN he’s worried about Republicans who embrace the “big lie” being put in positions of leadership.//Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade was another conservative figure who denounced Trump, saying on Fox’s Media Buzz Sunday that Trump’s failed to show evidence of his claims and needs to “learn to lose.”//Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), a longtime critic of Trump and a member of the committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, mocked Trump’s attack on Rounds, calling Trump a “snowflake” in a tweet Monday.//“I’m disappointed but not surprised by the former president’s reaction,” Rounds said in a statement after Trump’s attack Monday. “However, the facts remain the same. I stand by my statement. The former president lost the 2020 election.”//Trump’s false claims of election fraud were again the focal point of national media attention over the past week as the nation marked the first anniversary of Trump supporters storming the Capitol. Trump sent out a series of statements Thursday, the day of the anniversary, promoting conspiracy theories claiming he was the true winner of the 2020 presidential election, even though he actually lost by more than 7 million votes. Trump had initially planned to hold a news conference that day, primarily to attack politicians he views as “Rinos”—Republicans in name only—who do not buy in to the fraud claims. Trump later called off the news conference, reportedly amid pressure from fellow Republicans.//Trump has essentially made support for fraud claims a litmus test for candidates seeking his endorsement, which has proven to be extremely influential in Republican primaries. Polling has also consistently shown that Trump remains the most powerful figure in the Republican Party and GOP voters in large part believe the results of the 2020 election were fraudulent. The power of Trump’s endorsement will face its biggest test yet in May, when Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R), who is popular among Republicans, faces Trump-backed former U.S. Sen. David Perdue (R) in the state’s Republican gubernatorial primary. Kemp notably denied Trump’s claims that widespread fraud kept him from winning Georgia and resisted pressure to overturn the election results, leading to repeated attacks from Trump after the 2020 election.//GOP senator spars with Trump after calling out stolen election lie (NBC News)//Hutchinson says 'big lie' supporters 'not demonstrating leadership' (The Hill)//Fox News Host Brian Kilmeade Tells Donald Trump: 'Learn To Lose' (Newsweek)//Biden Blames Trump For January 6 Insurrection In Anniversary Address: ‘Values Power Over Principle’ (Forbes)//Trump Plans Press Conference On Jan. 6 Anniversary To Rehash Fraud Claims (Forbes)//Trump-Chosen Perdue Enters Georgia Race—And The War Of Words Begins (Forbes)//", 8.2%
"H-1B Visa Denial Rates Plunge After Trump Immigration Policies End", "Donald Trump holds up a "Buy American and Hire American" executive order after signing it at Snap-On ... [+] Tools in Kenosha, Wisconsin, April 18, 2017. / AFP PHOTO / SAUL LOEB (SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)//Donald Trump holds up a "Buy American and Hire American" executive order after signing it at Snap-On ... [+] Tools in Kenosha, Wisconsin, April 18, 2017. / AFP PHOTO / SAUL LOEB (SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)//H-1B denial rates have returned to pre-Trump levels after court decisions and a legal settlement ended the Trump administration’s restrictive policies, according to a new report. The changes started in the fourth quarter of FY 2020, while Donald Trump was still president, following a legal settlement with the business group ITServe Alliance and judges declaring the Trump administration’s policies unlawful. The lower denial rates continued through FY 2021 because the Biden administration abided by the legal settlement and did not introduce new restrictions.//“The denial rate for new H-1B petitions for initial employment in FY 2021 dropped to 4%, far lower than the denial rate of 24% in FY 2018, 21% in FY 2019 and 13% in FY 2020,” according to a new report from the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP). “The Trump administration managed to carry out what judges determined to be unlawful policies for nearly four years, and the policies imposed significant costs on employers, visa holders and the U.S. economy, likely contributing to more work and talent moving to other countries.” //H-1B petitions for “initial” employment are for new employment, normally a case for companies that counts against the H-1B annual limit. The FY 2020 denial rate would have been higher if not for the legal settlement. Court rulings also stopped U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) from continuing to impose new restrictions on who qualified for an H-1B specialty occupation.//The low H-1B denial rates in FY 2021 show the Trump administration’s anti-immigration approach was an aberration. “NFAP found the denial rates in FY 2021 and FY 2015 to be similar for employers, meaning the Trump years were an aberration due to imposing restrictive policies that courts found to be unlawful,” according to the report. “For several companies, particularly those that provide information technology (IT) services or other business services to U.S. companies, the denial rate for H-1B petitions for initial employment was far lower in FY 2021 than in FY 2020.”//H-1B temporary visas typically are the only practical way for a high-skilled foreign national, including an international student, to work long-term in the United States and have an opportunity to become an employment-based immigrant and a U.S. citizen. Many founders of billion-dollar companies and individuals who created the vaccines and delivered medical care that has saved the lives of Americans during the pandemic have used H-1B visas and employment-based green cards, notes NFAP.//Among the findings in the NFAP analysis://-     “The denial rate for H-1B petitions for continuing employment was 2% in FY 2021, much lower than the 12% denial rate in FY 2018 and FY 2019 and the lowest level since data on H-1B denial rates became available. H-1B petitions for ‘continuing’ employment are usually extensions for existing employees at the same company or an H-1B visa holder changing to a new employer. The denial rate for H-1B petitions for continuing employment was 7% in FY 2020 but would have been higher if not for the impact in the fourth quarter of the court decisions and the legal settlement. In recent history, the 7% denial rate was still high compared to the 3% denial rate for H-1B petitions for continuing employment each year between FY 2011 and FY 2015. //-     “Much of the increase in denials for continuing employment during the Trump administration was due to an October 2017 memo that instructed adjudicators to no longer ‘give deference to the findings of a previously approved petition.’ Many extensions of H-1B status were reviewed under a new, more restrictive standard based on policies that judges later determined to be unlawful. Employers and attorneys have credited USCIS Director Ur Jaddou and the Biden administration for rescinding the October 2017 memo.//-     Amazon had the most approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in FY 2021 with 6,182. Amazon also had the most new H-1B petitions approved in FY 2020. Infosys had the second most H-1B petitions in FY 2021 approved for initial employment (5,256), followed by TCS (3,063), Wipro (2,121) Cognizant (1,481), Google (1,453), IBM (1,402), HCL America (1,299) and Microsoft (1,240). //-     “Processing issues likely inflated the number of approved H-1B petitions for the top employers. In the USCIS data, H-1B petitions are counted in the fiscal year they are approved, not in the cap year the H-1B visa holder begins to work. NFAP determined approximately 18,000 more petitions were approved for initial employment in FY 2021 compared to FY 2020, possibly due to USCIS processing issues in FY 2020 caused by the pandemic and the higher denial rate in 2020. Another caveat to the numbers is that, according to attorneys, in FY 2019 and FY 2020 during the Trump administration, USCIS held or delayed H-1B applications for many IT services companies, which would have inflated the number of approved H-1B petitions for those companies in FY 2021. //-     “The top employers of approved H-1B petitions in FY 2021 were also among the fastest-growing employers of U.S. workers, providing evidence that companies that employ H-1B visa holders also seek out and employ U.S. workers in significant numbers. The information on the significant hiring of U.S. workers by employers of H-1B professionals helps demonstrate the fallacies of the zero-sum argument about high-skilled foreign nationals ‘taking’ American jobs, particularly since economists have found hiring high-skilled personnel complements other high-skilled jobs as well as other types of employment at a company and in the economy.//-     “At U.S. universities, only approximately 25% of the full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and computer and information sciences are U.S. students.”//Employers and high-skilled foreign nationals still have many problems. In March 2021, employers filed over 300,000 H-1B registrations for only 85,000 petitions available under the FY 2022 H-1B cap. That means the U.S. government rejected more than 70% of H-1B registrations for high-skilled foreign nationals before an adjudicator evaluated the applications. “That high percentage of rejections prior to adjudication indicates how restrictive current policies are toward high-skilled foreign nationals in America, particularly compared to other countries with which the United States competes for talent, including international students,” according to the NFAP analysis. “Restrictive policies toward employment-based green cards are also a significant problem.”//In her first State of American Business address, U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Suzanne P. Clark said, “We have to grow our workforce if we want to grow our economy and stay competitive.” She asked, “So, who wants to put their talent to work and pursue their dreams in a dynamic economy flush with opportunity? Immigrants of every skill level. Where are they going to go? The U.S. or Canada? Let’s make it Austin or Boston, Atlanta or Denver, or any of the countless U.S. destinations in search of top talent. We must double the number of people legally immigrating to the U.S. And we must create a permanent solution for the ‘dreamers.’”//Press reports have started to recognize that immigration restrictions have caused or worsened many of the labor supply problems in America. Preventing highly skilled individuals from working in America does not create more opportunities for U.S. workers. Instead, restrictive immigration policies reduce economic and employment growth, push work outside the United States and diminish living standards for Americans.//", 9.7%

Trump has not been as forthcoming as other former presidents about his vaccination status and stressed “individual choice,” though said he feels “very comfortable having taken them.” However, Trump said he was unsure why people would get the vaccine unless they were in a certain age group or had other health conditions—a statement that runs counter to public health guidance on the virus—and downplayed the risks of reinfection, which are significant with the spread of the more contagious omicron variant.   //Trump’s claims of election fraud were back on center stage in early January, as the country marked the first anniversary of his supporters storming the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the election on January 6.

In October, he unveiled Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which plans to go public by merging with blank-check company Digital World Acquisition Corp., and is aiming to launch a conservative-friendly social media app and  a “non-woke” subscription service offering news and entertainment content in the form of video and podcasts. On Tuesday, Republican Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), a Trump ally, resigned from Congress to helm the company. DWAC’s share price leaped nearly 400% one day after the merger announcement, with trading halted multiple times due to volatility, and shares closed at a high of $94.20 a day later, though the price has dropped since then and closed at $60.27 on Thursday. Trump’s company also said last month it raised $1 billion from unnamed institutional investors, part of a private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction.//In December, regulators from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority opened inquiries into the planned TMTG-DWAC merger, DWAC disclosed in a filing last month. //One poll suggested that over 60% of Republicans planned to use Truth Social.

"Trump Calls Off Press Conference On Capitol Attack Anniversary", "Former President Donald Trump cancelled a Thursday press conference marking the one-year anniversary of the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol, after some Republicans criticized his plan to use the Mar-a-Lago event to level unfounded election fraud claims. //Former President Donald Trump cancelled a Thursday press conference marking the one-year anniversary of the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol, after some Republicans criticized his plan to use the Mar-a-Lago event to level unfounded election fraud claims. //Former president Donald Trump had previously scheduled a press conference to take place January 6 at ... [+] his Florida resort.//Trump said in a statement Tuesday the cancellation was due to the “total bias and dishonesty” of a House committee investigating the events of January 6, 2021, as well as the “Fake News Media.”//Last month, Trump scheduled the press conference to take place at his Mar-a-lago resort in Florida, intending to attack Republicans who did not endorse his false voter fraud claims.//Trump said Tuesday  he will instead discuss the subject during a January 15 rally in Arizona.//Trump has consistently downplayed the Capitol riot and criticized the House committee’s investigation into the attack over the last year, claiming the root cause of the insurrection was to protest a “rigged” election. A request from the committee to view Trump Administration documents awaits a Supreme Court ruling after Trump sued to block their release, and Trump has often derided the group as the “Unselect Committee” and questioned the intentions of the two Republicans on the panel, Reps. Liz Cheney (Wy.) and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.). Trump has also referred to the rioters as “great people” and voiced his support for Ashli Babbitt, a rioter who was fatally shot by police while inside the Capitol. //Trump continued to advance his false assertions about the 2020 election in the Tuesday statement: “Also, why is the primary reason for the people coming to Washington D.C., which is the fraud of the 2020 Presidential Election, not the primary topic of the Unselect Committee’s investigation? This was, indeed, the Crime of the Century.”  //Trump’s planned press conference was denounced by several Republicans in Congress. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.) said Tuesday, “Early assumptions are that it's going to be an aggressive statement. I just don't think it's a good idea,” while Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) agreed it wasn’t a “terribly good idea.”//Trump cancels Jan. 6 event amid GOP complaints (Politico)//Trump cancels Florida press conference scheduled for Jan. 6 (Associated Press)//", 3.8%
