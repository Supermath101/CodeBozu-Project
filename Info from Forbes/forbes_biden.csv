"For Student Loan Cancellation To Happen, Biden Must Believe This", "President Joe Biden (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)//President Joe Biden (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)//For student loan cancellation to happen, President Joe Biden must believe this.//Here’s what you need to know — and what it means for your student loans.//Student loan advocates, progressive members of Congress and student loan borrowers are hoping that Biden enacts wide-scale student loan cancellation soon. While Biden has extended student loan relief for another 90 days, advocates really want student loan forgiveness. However, for Biden to take an unprecedented step and cancel student loans for borrowers, Biden must believe at least the following, including that://For Biden to enact wide-scale student loan forgiveness, Biden would have to believe that student loan borrowers are struggling financially. For there to be wide-scale student loan cancellation, this would apply not only to certain student loan borrowers, but would need to apply to most or all student loan borrowers. (Here are 5 major changes for student loans in 2022). There’s no question that certain segments of the student loan borrower population are struggling financially. For example, student loan borrowers who are unemployed, who have student loans in default, or who are in student loan deliquency may be some student loan borrowers who are struggling financially. Student loans can be expensive for many borrowers, and this has heightened during the Covid-19 pandemic. At the same time, Biden would need to weigh providing wide-scale student loan forgiveness with any other economic relief that he or Congress believes would be warranted. For example, this may include mortgage relief, rent relief, or even a fourth stimulus check. Does the Biden administration believe that student loan borrowers are struggling financially more than homeowners, renters or everyday Americans who may not have student loans or who didn’t go to college?//Biden would have to believe that current student loan relief is insufficient. Is student loan cancellation next? Supporters of wide-scale student loan cancellation argue that student loan relief has been helpful temporarily, but student loan cancellation will help student loan borrowers permanently. Biden has extended student loan relief from the Cares Act — the $2.2 trillion stimulus package that Congress passed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic — three times. Current student loan relief, which includes no mandatory federal student loan payments, 0% interest rates on federal student loans and no collection of student loans in default, will last temporarily until May 1, 2022. Biden’s extension, combined with Congress’ initial six months of student loan relief and President Donald Trump’s two extensions, will have granted student loan relief for more than two years. According to the U.S. Department of Education, student loan borrowers collectively have been saving $5 billion a month as a result of student loan relief. (Student loan borrowers will get $15 billion of student loan cancellation).//Biden would have to believe that income-driven repayment plans, which offer student loan forgiveness after meeting requirements, would be insufficient. The president has encouraged student loan borrowers to do 3 things to prepare for the restart of student loan payments. This includes enrollment in an income-driven repayment plan for federal student loans. There are four income-driven repayment plans: Income-Based Repayment (IBR), Pay As You Earn (PAYE), Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR). Income-driven repayment plans base your federal student loan payments on your discretionary income, family size and state of residence. Your monthly payment could be as low as $0 and you can qualify for student loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years of monthly student loan payments. (What Biden’s latest student loan relief means for your student loans).//Biden would have to believe that existing student loan forgiveness options are insufficient. (Here’s who won’t get student loan forgiveness). This includes, but is not limited to, public service loan forgiveness, teacher loan forgiveness and income-driven repayment. Biden announced major changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which will help more borrowers get access to student loan forgiveness. While these programs are targeted to specific types of borrowers and apply only to federal student loans, it’s important to note that there isn’t a student loan forgiveness program for every borrower.//For Biden to enact student loan cancellation, Biden would have to believe that Democrats need wide-scale student loan forgiveness to win the midterm elections. Student loan advocates have said that failure to enact wide-scale student loan forgiveness will alienate young voters, which will hurt voter turnout and result in Democrats losing the midterm elections. Opponents say the opposite: that student loan forgiveness could be the reason Democrats will lose the midterm elections. Why? While student loan borrowers support wide-scale student loan forgiveness, it’s less popular beyond progressive circles. While Democrats hold a slight majority in Congress, independent and moderate voters could play an increasingly important role in the midterm elections. From a political perspective, the Biden administration would need to weigh the risk of potentially losing Democratic base voters who have made student loan forgiveness a top priority with the risk of potentially alienating independent and moderates who view wide-scale student loan forgiveness as wealth redistribution. //From a cost-benefit perspective, Biden would have to believe that the benefits of student loan cancellation outweigh the relative costs. For example, supporters say wide-scale student loan cancellation would stimulate economy and help student loan borrowers have money to get married, start a family, buy a home, save for retirement and invest in a business. That said, student loan cancellation could cost up to $1 trillion of up to $50,000 of student loans is cancelled for student loan borrowers. That cost would decrease to approximately $400 billion if up to $10,000 were cancelled for student loan borrowers.//Wide-scale student loan cancellation is predicated on Biden having the legal authority to cancel student loans for all borrowers. (If you’re waiting for student loan forgiveness, do this). The procedural path to student loan cancellation espoused by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is predicated on Biden cancelling student loans by executive order. According to Schumer and Warren, that power is granted to the president through the Higher Education Act of 1965. However, Biden, a lawyer and former chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary, doesn’t believe that the president has unilateral authority to enact wide-scale student loan cancellation without further authorization from Congress. The president, through the U.S. Department of Education, has limited authority to cancel student loans — and Biden has cancelled $12.7 billion of student loans — but that cancellation has been through existing programs authorized by Congress. However, for wide-scale student loan cancellation, the Biden administration would need to believe that Congress — which controls federal spending — uncharacteristically relinquished its constitutional powers and gave the president — a member of the Executive branch — through the Higher Education Act unlimited power to cancel all student loans for every student loan borrower.//Whether you support or oppose wide-scale student loan forgiveness, there’s no guarantee there will be student loan cancellation.

Today the Justices of the Supreme Court are hearing arguments against U.S. President Joe Biden’s private sector Covid-19 vaccination rules. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)//In a major blow to President Joe Biden’s campaign to combat Covid, the U.S. Supreme Court today blocked implementation of his plan to require employers with more than 100 workers to have them vaccinated for Covid-19 or tested weekly for the virus. //In oral arguments before the Court last week, opponents of the mandates told the justices the requirements would cost businesses billions of dollars, impose administrative hardships on companies and organizations and force many people to quit their jobs. //U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices told the justices that Biden’s mandates would save 6,500 lives and prevent 250,000 hospitalizations in the next six months, and that exposure to Covid-19 is the biggest threat to workers in OHSA’s history. //Forbes reported that the proposed mandate will now go back to the lower courts to decide whether it will be permanently upheld or struck down. //Covid-19 has proven to be that rare crisis that has faced a series of political and legal challenges that have delayed or weakened efforts to address it.//Jackie Gessner is an associate at Barnes & Thornburg where she focuses on employment counseling and litigation, as well as OSHA compliance. She said today’s decision, “... comes as a massive sigh of relief for businesses already saddled with the difficult task of addressing COVID-19 risks in the workplace.”//“Businesses were struggling with how to handle large numbers of exemption requests and the seemingly impossible task of administering weekly tests, especially given the test supply shortage. This decision returns the decision making power to individual businesses, often more equipped to identify the best safety solutions for their workforce,” according to Gessner.//In an unsigned opinion, the court wrote that, “Although Congress has indisputably given OSHA the power to regulate occupational dangers, it has not given that agency the power to regulate public health more broadly,” the court wrote in an unsigned opinion. //“Requiring the vaccination of 84 million Americans, selected simply because they work for employers with more than 100 employees, certainly falls in the latter category,” the court said. //Liberal Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan issued a blistering dissent, according to CNN.//"When we are wise, we know not to displace the judgments of experts, acting within the sphere Congress marked out and under Presidential control, to deal with emergency conditions," they wrote.  //"Today, we are not wise. In the face of a still-raging pandemic, this Court tells the agency charged with protecting worker safety that it may not do so in all the workplaces needed. As disease and death continue to mount, this Court tells the agency that it cannot respond in the most effective way possible." //Michael Elkins, partner and founder of  MLE Law, said today’s ruling was “... one of the most anticipated employment decisions in recent memory...” He observed that, “The lynchpin of the decision was simple and practical, OSHA has the ability to regulate ‘workplace’ hazards, not implement broad public health measures, which it says the OSHA rule is. //“The Court aptly points out that Covid is more of a universal risk than a unique workplace hazard. Basically, the Court found that OSHA went too far and exceeded its power. In striking down this rule, the Court did note that OSHA likely can regulate certain industries or jobs, such as researchers working with Covid-19, or the risks of working in particularly cramped or crowded environments,” he commented.//“At the end of the day, I view this as a practical decision, focusing on the idea that OSHA doesn’t have this exceedingly broad regulatory authority,” Elkins concluded.//David Gordon, partner with Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp said that, “With today’s SCOTUS ruling, employers will now be free to set their own requirements, subject to applicable State and Local laws. If the Supreme Court had upheld the OSHA requirement, the local rules would have been preempted and large employers would have been obligated to disregard them.”//“This ruling has significant impact on the job market, as it’s no longer an even playing field among large employers in terms of recruitment. Now, if a large employer believes that it would be advantageous not to require employees to be vaccinated, it will be free not to adopt a vaccine mandate if permissible where they are located,” he said.//“This ruling makes no difference for New York City employers and employers in other jurisdictions that will require that all employees be vaccinated. Employers in those locations will still be subject to applicable vaccine mandates,” Gordon noted.// Jeff Levin-Scherz, M.D., population health leader at Willis Towers Watson, said that, “Our recent survey suggest that many more employers would have pursued vaccine mandates if the rule was left in place.//“Many employers had already put mandates in place and we believe many will continue to do so where permitted. The omicron variant has proven so contagious that it will take very high vaccination rates to quell outbreaks. //“Vaccines help employers decrease the risk of infection at the workplace and the risk of workplace disruption, as those who are fully vaccinated are not just less likely to be infected, they also don't need to quarantine if they are exposed at work or outside of work,” he observed.//“Employers continue to be in the forefront of efforts to make it easy for employees to get vaccinated, including offering flexible schedules, paid time off for vaccination and recovery. Some have offered on-site vaccination. //“Vaccinations are one important element of employer efforts to protect workers. Employers can also reduce risk of Covid transmission through increased ventilation, decreased worker density, and indoor masking,” Levin-Scherz concluded.//", 7.7%
"President Biden Is Deploying The Military To Support Hospitals Overwhelmed With Covid-19", "Yet again, hospitals and healthcare systems are getting crushed by Covid-19. For many healthcare professionals and front-line workers, this is eerily reminiscent of March 2020, when much was still unknown about the virus and every day at work seemed like a life-risking endeavor. Many things have changed since then. Most importantly, the advent of effective vaccines against the virus has made the battle against Covid-19 that much more fruitful. Additionally, more is now known about the virus, including about how it mutates and what to somewhat expect with variants and their respective surges. However, some things have stayed the same since the inception of the pandemic, including dire amounts of misinformation, vaccine hesitancy, and a generalized disregard by many in following public health recommendations.    //Yet again, hospitals and healthcare systems are getting crushed by Covid-19. For many healthcare professionals and front-line workers, this is eerily reminiscent of March 2020, when much was still unknown about the virus and every day at work seemed like a life-risking endeavor.

However, some things have stayed the same since the inception of the pandemic, including dire amounts of misinformation, vaccine hesitancy, and a generalized disregard by many in following public health recommendations.    //Currently, the world is facing a massive surge in Covid-19 coronavirus cases, due in large part to the Omicron variant of the virus. Public health organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contend that this new variant “likely will spread more easily than the original SARS-CoV-2 virus,” which explains the rampantly growing rates of infection worldwide. However, the true severity of the disease and the long-term effects caused by this new variant are still largely a mystery, as healthcare organizations are still grappling with navigating this immediate crisis.//Earlier this week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released alarming data, indicating that over the last 7 days, the case count number amounts to nearly 4.7 million people and nearly 10,000+ deaths, a 52.2% and 31.4%, change from the previous week, respectively. Indeed, these figures are jarring. //These findings are likely a large part of why earlier today, President Joe Biden announced a momentous initiative: the plan to deploy military personnel to support hospitals systems that are overwhelmed by Covid-19. //WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 29: U.S. President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the Omicron COVID-19 ...

The World Health Organization designated it a variant of concern after South African health officials discovered the variant last week. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)//In his speech, President Biden explained: “I know we’re all frustrated as we enter this new year. The Omicron variant is causing millions of cases and record hospitalizations. I’ve been — I’ve been saying that, as we remain in this pandemic, this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. And I mean by this: Right now, both vaccinated and unvaccinated people are testing positive, but what happens after that could not be more different. If vaccinated people test positive, they overwhelmingly have either no symptoms at all or they have mild symptoms. And if they’re — if you’re unvaccinated — if they test positive — there are — you are 17 times more likely to get hospitalized.”//He emphatically remarked: “…as long as we have tens of millions of people who will not get vaccinated, we’re going to have full hospitals and needless deaths.”//Thus, President Biden continued on to announce his multi-step plan. First and foremost, he reiterated the importance of vaccinations. Next, he went on to discuss the importance of masking, and how “We’ve more than tripled our stockpile of the most protective, specialized N95 masks since coming into office. This is going to make sure that there will be an ample supply [for] healthcare workers and first responders.” He also discussed increasing testing capacity, ensuring that more Covid-19 tests will be available to all Americans, moving forward.//Perhaps most importantly, President Biden also went on to explain his efforts to aid hospitals and healthcare systems in distress: “Today, I’m announcing our next deployment of six additional federal medical teams, a total of more than 120 military medical personnel, to six hard-hit states: Michigan, [New Mexico], New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island.” This is in addition to “over 800 military and other federal emergency personnel [that] have been deployed to 24 states, Tribes, and territories, including over 350 military doctors, nurses, and medics” since Thanksgiving, as well as “the more than 14,000 National Guard members that are active — activated in 49 states.”//The USNS Comfort medical ship moves up the Hudson River past the Statue of Liberty as it arrives on ...

Rather, it is boldly indicative of President Biden’s fortitude in fighting this pandemic head-on, as the initiative is meant to provide those on the front-lines with some semblance of support, comradery, and hope. Furthermore, with the current trajectory of this surge, this extra help could not be better timed; healthcare professionals have never faced higher levels of burnout; hospital systems are getting crushed by record-breaking patient volumes; and many bystanders that need acute care have no beds and nowhere to go.

"If Biden Cancels Student Loans, He Will Consider These 7 Things", "President Joe Biden (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)//President Joe Biden (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)//Here’s what President Joe Biden will consider if he decides to cancel student loans.//Here’s what you need to know.//There’s direct pressure on Biden to enact wide-scale student loan cancellation for more than 40 million student loan borrowers. Progressive members of Congress and student loan advocates want the president to use an executive order to grant one-time student loan forgiveness of up to $50,000 for federal student loan borrowers. To date, Biden has neither supported $50,000 of student loan cancellation or wide-scale student loan forgiveness by executive order. However, Biden has urged Congress to pass legislation that would cancel up to $10,000 of student loans. (Here are 5 major changes for student loans in 2022).//If Biden decides to act on wide-scale student loan forgiveness, he’s likely to evaluate at least 7 things to reach a final decision://////In considering any potential wide-scale student loan cancellation, top of mind for the Biden administration will be the cost. There are multiple proposals to cancel student loans for student loan borrowers. The total cost depends on several factors, which may include the number of student loan borrowers, how much student loan debt is cancelled, and what limitations, if any, are applied. In any of these scenarios, wide-scale student loan cancellation could cost hundreds of billions of dollars and potentially $1 trillion. (Student loans are paused, but here are 6 things to do right now).//Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has proposed to cancel all private and federal student loan debt. If Biden cancelled all federal student loan debt — which is highly unlikely to happen — the total cost would be approximately $1.5 trillion. //Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have proposed to cancel up to $50,000 of student loans for federal student loan borrowers who earn up to $125,000 annually. (Here’s who qualifies for student loan forgiveness right now). The U.S. Department of Education estimates that this would completely cancel student loans for 36 million borrowers. If Biden implemented this proposal, which is also highly unlikely, the total cost could be approximately $1 trillion. //Biden’s plan to cancel up to $10,000 of student loans could cost approximately $400 billion. //Alternatively, if Biden enacted student loan cancellation, he could choose a different amount of student loan forgiveness and could limit the number of student loan borrowers who qualify.//Biden will evaluate the health of the U.S. economy before making any decision on wide-scale student loan forgiveness. The Biden administration has argued for months that the economy is recovering. That said, Biden’s Build Back Better legislative agenda has stalled in Congress, but it’s a major component to help spur economic growth. If Biden enacts wide-scale student loan cancellation, it could be viewed as conflicting with his economic message. On one hand, student loan cancellation would be granted to help student loan borrowers who are struggling financially. On the other, the economy is supposedly recovering, which would suggest more student loan relief wouldn’t be warranted. (More student loan relief could be coming).//Biden will also consider the progression of the Covid-19 pandemic, including the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, before implementing any student loan cancellation. The Covid-19 pandemic impacts student loan borrowers in several ways, including from both a health and economic perspective. With daily Covid-19 cases surpassing 1 million, Biden would consider whether cases have peaked and whether Covid-19 will continue to impact student loan borrowers’ ability to repay their student loans.//Is student debt cancellation next? Maybe, but Biden also will consider what happens if there is no wide-scale student loan forgiveness. Some say there will be significant student loan default. For example, citing a recent study, Warren has warned that 89% of student loan borrowers aren’t prepared financially to restart student loan payments. (Biden extended student loan relief, but advocates really want student loan cancellation). Warren also has said that millions of student loan borrowers could default on their student loans if student loan debt is not cancelled. In his announcement to extend student loan relief for a third time, Biden encouraged student loan borrowers to do these 3 things. These strategies suggest that the president is encouraging student loan borrowers to prepare for the restart of student loan payments and to pursue student loan repayment strategies beyond student loan cancellation. (Student loans are paused, but here’s 6 things to do now).//While progressives have criticized Biden for not implementing wide-scale student loan cancellation, Biden has cancelled more student loans than any president in U.S. history. (Here’s how to get student loan forgiveness during the Biden administration). Since becoming president last year, Biden has cancelled $12.7 billion of student loans. This includes student loan cancellation for public servants, student loan borrowers with a total and permanent disability, and student loan borrowers who were misled by their college or university under the borrower defense to repayment rule. (Student loan borrowers will now get $15 billion of student loan cancellation). While Biden has focused on targeted student loan cancellation, he will weigh this approach when considering wide-scale student loan cancellation. While progressives will argue there is no limit to the amount of student loan cancellation that Biden can implement, Biden likely will balance the amount of federal spending to date through prior and ongoing student loan cancellation.//Instead of wide-scale student loan cancellation, Biden may consider other ways to deliver student loan relief. First, although less likely, Biden could extend student loan relief beyond May 1, 2022. Second, Biden could encourage more student loan borrowers who are struggling financially to enroll in an income-driven repayment plan. Third, Biden may make more resources available through the U.S. Department of Education that can help student loan borrowers transition to federal student loan repayment. Fourth, Biden could create a grace period for student loan borrowers when student loan payments restart, with special consideration for student loan borrowers who are in student loan default or student loan delinquency.//Biden will also consider the impact of student loan forgiveness on the midterm elections in November 2022. Biden has been in politics for nearly 50 years and understands elections and the political landscape well. Progressives in Congress say enacting student loan forgiveness is essential if Democrats want to win the midterm elections. They argue that failure to cancel up to $50,000 of student loans will mean Democrats will lose the midterm elections. Other says that student loan forgiveness could be the reason that Democrats will lose the midterm elections. While popular among student loan borrowers and progressives in Congress, wide-scale student loan cancellation isn’t universally popular with the U.S. electorate or in Congress. Progressives support wide-scale student loan cancellation, but some moderate and independent voters — particularly in swing districts — may view wide-scale student loan cancellation as a form of wealth redistribution and lack of personal responsibility. No matter whether you support or oppose wide-scale student loan forgiveness, Biden is sure to consider the political implications.//Student loan forgiveness won’t last forever. Student loan cancellation isn’t guaranteed. Therefore, make sure you understand your options for student loan repayment. Here are some popular ways to pay off student loans://////", 12.5%

"The Great Inflation Debate: Will Team Biden Increase Retail Tariffs?", "Former President Trump developed the China trade war, as retailers were broadcasting stern warnings ... [+] that inflation would spike significantly with added tariffs. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)//Former President Trump developed the China trade war, as retailers were broadcasting stern warnings ... [+] that inflation would spike significantly with added tariffs. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)//It was former President Trump who developed the China trade war–as retailers were broadcasting stern warnings that inflation would spike significantly with added tariffs. Trump’s globalists agreed with the retail group but, unfortunately, the nationalists persevered. President Trump eventually tweeted his thought that: “Trade wars are good and easy to win.” //As the tariffs first hit, complaints were launched to government and to the media, but the American consumer was eventually ignored, and the tariffs powered up today’s inflation rate. No one in wholesale or retail was surprised by the rising prices, only consumers expressed a degree of shock.//To this day, there was never a pause in the action, but retail was truly relieved when the tariff frenzy peaked on Jan.15, 2020 in the East Room of the White House–with the signing of the two year China Phase One Trade Agreement. Retail didn’t win anything in the agreement, but the uncertainty of the moment had been eclipsed, and a longer-term resolution was potentially in place. //It still remains painful for some to look back at the past two years, but the recently expired trade agreement is hitting its anniversary date in just a few days. Policy wonks who follow the Administration’s lackluster exclusion process, or their hard line against China–now wonder if Team Biden will use the anniversary date to acknowledge the agreement–with even more tariffs against China. Sections that covered apparel and footwear were halved under tranche 4A and eliminated under 4B–but most fashion apparel (and about half of the footwear)–still remain under siege and the balance could be re-instated. //Retail asked for complete removal of all the tariffs, and for more product exemptions to be allowed, but requests have been repeatedly denied. The American consumer still foots the bill for all these tariffs, and for all the subsequent delays caused by the supply chain quagmire. No one in government seems interested in retail’s tale of distress, nor is anyone paying attention to the significant bankruptcies that have plagued the industry. Perhaps, in that light, retail should just reverse the ask, so that more people in government might pay attention. It would sound like this: “Please add back or raise the apparel and footwear tariffs and then fashion could charge the American consumer even more money, stoke more inflation, have more bankruptcies, and create more job loss.”//Fashion retail loves a good story and especially a Cinderella story. So, when the clock strikes midnight on Jan. 14, the fashion industry may, once again, see that its beautiful gown turns back into rags–especially if the government reacts to the January 15 anniversary of the China Phase One–by adding or re-instating tariffs. //Former President Trump will say that he was the first President to challenge China, and that his trade deal was a huge success. In 2020, he called out his effort at an event, saying: “I stood up to China like no other Administration in history. For decades they’ve ripped us off. They ripped us off like nobody…..and I charged them a little thing called massive tariffs. We took in billions and billions of dollars.”//Truth be told, the China Phase One deal didn’t deliver anything - except for the massive USA inflation predicted by retail. Nationalists will tell you that China was taught a lesson, but Globalists will tell you that the deal was a colossal failure. Certainly, the numbers point to failure. In the two years of the agreement, according to Chad Brown at the Peterson Institute for International Economics China purchased about 60% of their commitment.//Some importers tried to move production away from China (to avoid the tariffs) and smaller ships began arriving at our American ports from multiple locations with no appointments to dock. This particular action was a disruptive element to the massive shipping debacle that has already clogged our port system. To make matters worse, containers from the ships needed chassis (wheels) when they hit the ground, but the Biden Administration tariffed inbound container chassis from China at a 221% rate - to foster domestic American production. Protecting an existing industry is often a good thing, but doing it at a time when we already had a huge chassis shortage - may not have been the best choice. All this is causing Americans to wonder which Administration made things worse. Was it President Trump for starting the China trade war, or is it President Biden for not ending it. //Washington’s bipartisan and fiscally conservative Tax Foundation indicates that the Trump Administration increased taxes (via tariffs) to the tune of some $80 billion dollars which was the highest USA tax increase in decades. They also estimate that $78.7 billion remains in place under President Biden, and $70.8 billion of that is solely related to the 301 tariffs levied against China.//In 2002, President George W. Bush launched a tariff on steel products. It was designed to last 3 years, but was cancelled after only 21 months. An analysis by the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition found that 200,000 general manufacturing jobs were lost during this tariff action. //In 2009, President Obama took a tough stance against China and launched a three-year tariff program against low-cost tires. When the dust settled, the Peterson Institute estimated that the 1,200 jobs that were saved by the program–but the actual cost to consumers was about $900,000 for each job that was saved.//In 2018, President Trump added a tariff to washing machines and the results were equally disastrous. The price of washing machines and dryers went way up, and the American public was hit with a bill estimated at $1.5 billion. It’s true that about 1,800 jobs were developed, but the cost (as indicated in a 2019 Washington Post Article) was about $815,000 for every job created.//Tariffs didn’t work for President Bush in 2002, they didn’t work for President Obama in 2009, they didn’t work for President Trump in 2018, and they won’t work for President Biden in 2022.//As we approach Jan. 15 Anniversary of the China Phase One Trade Agreement, many wonder if the American consumer will see additional tariffs or more product exclusions. Retailers find it difficult to understand why the Biden Administration perpetuates the Trumpian concept that tariffs are somehow good and level the playing field. //Nobody ever wins a trade war. Nobody.//Mark McKinnon of Showtime’s “The Circus” said it best: “As history has repeatedly proven, one trade tariff begets another, then another – until you’ve got a full-blown trade war.

"It’s Official: Trump Loses ‘Tariff Man’ Crown To Biden, 2021 Data Shows", "President Trump raised tariffs, largely on China, while he was in office and President Biden has ... [+] largely kept them in place.//President Trump raised tariffs, largely on China, while he was in office and President Biden has ... [+] largely kept them in place.//The United States collected more in tariffs in the first 11 months of 2021 than any full year in U.S. history.//That means, as I forecast earlier this year, with only three months of data out, that former President Donald Trump, who gave himself the moniker “Tariff Man” now officially ranks second to President Biden, who has largely left his predecessor's tariffs in place.//Through November, the latest U.S. trade data available about 38% of U.S. trade was an export and 62% ... [+] an import. In recent years, the percentage has been closer to 40-60.//The reason: Imports are up and trade is slightly less balanced.// Tariffs are fees placed on imports from other countries. The oft-stated goal of tariffs is to either reduce trade deficits or to combat what are deemed to be unfair trade practices.//Tariffs, initially the way the United States raised money to pay for its young government, before there was an income tax, are generally frowned upon by economists and the pro-trade community. (I am a member of the second but not the first.)//Economists (and many in the pro-trade community) believe tariffs are actually a hidden tax on consumers, in this case U.S. consumers. The notion is that once the cost to the importer increases, the importer passes that cost along to the retailer, who in turns passes that cost on to the consumer.//I am less convinced. Because there is another option. //Squeeze the manufacturer. Or squeeze the players in the supply chain.//That might explain why, during the Trump Administration, when he could still rightfully crown himself Tariff Man, there was no significant inflation, to the Federal Reserve’s chagrin, even as tariff collections doubled from the last year of his predecessor, Barack Obama.//And, oh yes, imports increased.//The inflation we are experiencing now — the inflation rate released today was the highest since 1982 — is caused by too much money in the economy and too little to spend it on. //I think the economists call that supply and demand.//The “too much money” came from Trump’s decision to send checks to Americans and U.S. businesses in an effort to prevent the economy from going into a tailspin as it was shut down by the then-nascent coronavirus, a well-intentioned plan which in that sense succeeded. //The problem is, this was at the same time that Americans were not able to spend money on restaurants, concerts, hotels and flights. So they bought stuff. Lots of stuff. Lots of imported stuff. Biden largely kept those policies, as well as Trump’s tariffs, in place.//And we expected a different outcome?//If either Trump or Biden had really cared about the U.S. merchandise trade deficit, which is on track to set a record this year — Trump had three record deficits in four years — either one could have told us to save our money.//They could have suggested we save our money, which economists suggest is the only way to cut trade deficits — to increase the savings rate. //But neither Trump nor Biden (thus far) has suggested we stop buying so much stuff, particularly imported stuff like cell phones, computers, TVs, cars and clothes.// So here we are. Imports are up, inflation is up and tariffs are up, way up.//Through November, the United States has collected a record $77.4 billion in tariffs on imports, according to my analysis of just-released U.S. Census data. The December data will be released in early February.//The previous record, set in 2019, was $74.1 billion, as Trump ramped up tariffs on some $300 billion in imports from China in addition to steel tariffs, washing machine tariffs and solar panel tariffs. //During Obama’s last full year in office, the United States collected $34.41 billion in tariffs, or less than half of the top totals by his two successors.//With one month to go, it’s safe to assume the total for all of 2021 will be about $85 billion, even with all those ships stuck out in the Pacific, off the coast of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.//And former President Trump will no longer rightfully be known as Tariff Man.

[+] nexus between economic policy and national security seems weak. //As they put it, “advocating industrial policy (broadly speaking, government actions aimed at reshaping the economy) was once considered embarrassing—now it should be considered something close to obvious.”//These views are echoed in the Biden administration’s interim national security strategic guidance, which asserts, “in today’s world, economic security is national security.”//The guidance begins by stating that the current moment in history “requires a new and broader understanding of national security, one that recognizes that our role in the world depends on our strength and vitality here at home.”//It proceeds to extol the virtues of resilience, innovation, competitiveness and “truly shared prosperity.”//This sounds promising, hinting that the first faltering steps towards a national economic philosophy equal to the China challenge, which began under President Trump, will be refined and extended by his successor.//However, the Biden economic philosophy, at least to date, turns out to be more a reflection of domestic political forces than external threats.//Rather than strengthening the national economy in an era of great-power rivalry, Biden’s policies are more likely to continue a secular decline in U.S. economic power that began with China’s accession to the World Trade Organization two decades ago.//With the best of intentions, President Biden has propounded a backward-looking economic philosophy that reflects little grasp of the challenges U.S. power faces today.//Consider two core features of the Biden approach, taxes and antitrust.//Taxes. Biden began his tenure by embracing an ambitious assortment of social-welfare and climate initiatives collectively known as “Build Back Better.”//Whatever the merits of those initiatives may be, the proposed method of paying for them would have greatly increased the tax burden on corporations and individual investors.//For starters, the president endorsed raising the statutory income-tax rate on publicly traded corporations from 21% to 28%, only three years after the Trump administration had succeeded in lowering the rate from 35%.//When combined with the additional levies placed on corporate income at the state level, this would have increased the combined federal-state tax burden on major corporations from 26% to 32%.//But that was just the beginning, because Biden also endorsed treating long-term capital gains and dividends as normal income, meaning corporate earnings would be taxed a second time at the individual investor level at rates up to nearly 40%.//According to the Tax Foundation, combining the proposed maximum tax rates at both the corporate and individual levels, Biden’s policies would have resulted in the U.S. having the highest integrated tax rates of any OECD country.//Nearly 63% of corporate earnings could have been taxed away, reducing resources available for research and capital investment, and thereby undercutting U.S. economic competitiveness.//Before corporate tax rates were reduced under Trump, some major corporations were actually moving their headquarters overseas to avoid the high level of taxation in the U.S.//Biden’s policies, had they not been blocked by Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema (whose vote was crucial to passing Build Back Better legislation), would have made it much harder to restore the nation’s decaying industrial base.//Antitrust. The Biden administration inherited from the Trump years a bipartisan movement to restrain and potentially break up some of the nation’s biggest tech companies.//Biden soon made it clear that he intended to apply antitrust law to a far broader swath of the nation’s industries.//By the end of the president’s first year in office, his administration had launched antitrust investigations or other actions against the oil and gas industry; the maritime shipping industry; the meatpacking industry; the railroad industry; the insurance industry; the publishing industry; and even big-box retailers.//Some of these initiatives were tied to supply-chain problems originating in the global pandemic, but collectively they implied a distrust of economic forces as the preferred mechanism for regulating market behavior.//The administration’s trust-busting philosophy is seemingly at odds with the dictates of its national-security guidance, which emphasizes the importance of encouraging innovation.//The Boston Consulting Group’s 2021 survey of the world’s most innovative companies is dominated by U.S.-based enterprises, particularly tech firms; the four most innovative firms, in descending order of rank, are assessed to be Apple 
 
AAPL
, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft 
 
MSFT
 (Facebook is ranked number 13).//The antitrust crusaders that Biden has installed at the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and in the White House thus are seeking to limit enterprises that have contributed disproportionately to U.S. economic growth and global influence.//Antitrust law in the U.S. first took root at a time when companies like Standard Oil operated behind the world’s highest tariff walls.//Today those tariff walls have been largely dismantled, and the biggest rivals to America’s leading innovators are headquartered overseas—especially in China.//China, which is in a race to out-innovate America, would likely treat companies like Apple and Alphabet as national treasures, and provide them with extensive protections if not outright subsidies.//The Biden administration treats them like potential threats, and seeks to constrain their operations.//Whatever the domestic political logic of attacking big tech, or the energy sector, or other leading industries may be, it seems inconsistent with the goals the national security strategic guidance seeks to advance.//You can call that an industrial policy if you want, but the notion it will make life “better, safer and easier for working families in America,” as the guidance demands, is debatable.//It is more likely to facilitate China’s rise to the status of global competitor in the few fields where the U.S. still leads.//", 12.9%
"Supreme Court Blocks Biden’s Private Employer Vaccine Mandate But Lets Healthcare Rule Take Effect", "The Supreme Court delivered a mixed ruling on the Biden Administration’s workplace Covid-19 vaccination requirements Thursday, reinstating a vaccine mandate for healthcare workers but temporarily blocking the vaccine-or-test rule for large private employers as litigation against both moves forward.//The Supreme Court delivered a mixed ruling on the Biden Administration’s workplace Covid-19 vaccination requirements Thursday, reinstating a vaccine mandate for healthcare workers but temporarily blocking the vaccine-or-test rule for large private employers as litigation against both moves forward.//The U.S. Supreme Court on January 7 in Washington, D.C. //The court weighed whether to temporarily halt the vaccine-or-test mandate for private employers and whether to reinstate a vaccination requirement for healthcare workers, which federal appeals courts had blocked in a combined 24 states.//The business groups and GOP-led states challenging the policies argued the federal government did not have the authority to implement them without congressional approval and the rules would wreak havoc by causing widespread staffing shortages.//The court ruled 6-3 to block the vaccine-or-test mandate, ruling it believes the Labor Secretary Marty Walsh “lacked authority to impose the mandate” and it should have been left up to Congress to decide.//The vaccine-or-test mandate is a “significant encroachment” into employees’ lives and health, the court ruled, and letting the federal government “regulate the hazards of daily life” would significantly expand its authority.//It ruled 5-4 the federal government did have the authority to impose the healthcare policy, however, pointing out vaccine requirements are “common” for healthcare workers and many are actually in favor of the policy.//The private employer mandate had already taken effect January 4 and started being enforced January 10, while the healthcare rule isn’t due to start being enforced until later this month.//“Although Congress has indisputably given OSHA the power to regulate occupational dangers, it has not given that agency the power to regulate public health more broadly,” the court wrote in an unsigned opinion about the private employer mandate. “Requiring the vaccination of 84 million Americans, selected simply because they work for employers with more than 100 employees, certainly falls in the latter category.”//Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor dissented in the private employer case and wouldn’t have blocked it, writing in their dissent the court was “acting outside of its competence and without legal basis” and its decision “stymies the Federal Government’s ability to counter the unparalleled threat that Covid-19 poses to our Nation’s workers.” Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett would have blocked the healthcare worker mandate, arguing the Biden Administration “has not made a strong showing” that the Department of Health and Human Services has the power to “[authorize] a nationwide vaccine mandate” and the issue should be left up to the states.//Both mandate cases will now go back to the lower courts to decide whether they’ll be permanently upheld or struck down. With the healthcare mandate now in effect, healthcare workers will be required to receive a first Covid-19 vaccine dose by January 27 and be fully compliant with the policy by February 28.//The vaccine mandates are two of four the Biden Administration has imposed, along with vaccination requirements for federal contractors and employees, and have proved controversial even as most Americans say they’re in favor of them. The private employer policy, which applies to workplaces with more than 100 employees, was initially blocked by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in November before the 6th Circuit reinstated it in December, and the 5th and 8th Circuit Courts of Appeals blocked the healthcare policy in December—though the 5th Circuit loosened a lower court ruling that had paused the policy nationwide. While its legal fate has still been up in the air amid the Supreme Court’s consideration of it, many major employers have prepared to comply with it, with companies like Starbucks and Macy’s announcing new vaccination measures this week ahead of the Supreme Court hearing. The Supreme Court’s ruling on the healthcare worker policy, which applies to employees in facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid, came after the court had previously issued rulings upholding several state-level healthcare worker vaccine mandates, including in Maine and New York.//The Supreme Court itself requires all attorneys to test negative for Covid-19 before they appear before it, and all nine justices are fully vaccinated and boosted. Two of the lawyers who argued against the mandates, Ohio Solicitor General Benjamin Flower and Louisiana Solicitor General Liz Murrill, participated remotely in Friday’s oral arguments because they tested positive for Covid-19.//Supreme Court Justices Signal They May Block Biden’s Vaccine Mandate For Private Employers — But Not For Healthcare Workers (Forbes)//Supreme Court Now Weighing Multiple Lawsuits Against Biden’s Vaccine Mandate (Forbes)//Here’s Who’s Most—And Least—Likely To Support Vaccine Mandates In The Workplace (Forbes)//Appeals Court Lets Biden’s Healthcare Worker Vaccine Mandate Take Effect In 26 States (Forbes)//Appeals Court Restores Biden’s Vaccine-Or-Test Mandate For Large Employers (Forbes)//Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus//", 8.0%

[+] Capitol on January 6, 2022 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Greg Nash-Pool/Getty Images)//A coalition of advocacy groups is calling on President Biden to enact sweeping changes to income-driven repayment plans for federal student loan borrowers.//Income-driven repayment (IDR) is a category of federal student loan repayment plans that tie a borrower’s monthly payment to their income. The plans use a formula that bases a borrower’s payment on their Adjusted Gross Income and family size. Borrowers must recertify their income annually, resulting in periodic adjustments to their monthly payments. If any loan balance remains after 20 or 25 years (depending on the plan), it gets forgiven, although this could be treated as taxable “income” for many borrowers under current law. //Advocates for student loan borrowers have been critical of the current IDR system, pointing out a number of serious, systemic problems://////On Wednesday, the National Consumer Law Center, the Student Borrower Protection Center, and the Center For Responsible Lending released a joint proposal calling on the Biden administration to use executive action to provide relief to borrowers by temporarily relaxing IDR plan requirements and restrictions. The groups called for several major changes://////The groups liken the proposal to the Limited PSLF Waiver program announced by the Biden administration in October. Under that program, the Biden administration is temporarily relaxing key program requirements for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to allow more borrowers to potentially qualify for relief. //“The promise of IDR forgiveness after 20 to 25 years should be a light at the end of the tunnel for student loan borrowers,” said Abby Shafroth, director of the National Consumer Law Center’s Student Loan Borrower Assistance project, in a statement. “But just as 99% of public servants who thought they had qualified for PSLF forgiveness after the first 10 years of the program were denied—owing to a combination of program complexity, poor servicing and servicing errors—a vanishingly small number of borrowers are qualifying for IDR forgiveness 25 years into the program’s existence for these same reasons. The Department did the right thing by acknowledging that the system had failed borrowers in public service and waiving barriers to PSLF forgiveness, and should do the same thing to restore IDR’s promise.”//“Millions of student loan borrowers are buckling under the weight of a broken system,” said Persis Yu, Policy Director and Managing Counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center. “The failures of income-driven repayment have kept borrowers in unaffordable debt for decades too long. It is time for the Biden Administration to do its part and fulfill the promise of IDR by giving borrowers the credit they deserve.”//So far, the Biden administration has not indicated that it has any plans to institute immediate changes to income-driven repayment plans through executive action as it did for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.//The Education Department released a proposal last year for a new income-driven plan, tentatively called Expanded Income Contingent Repayment, or EICR. While the proposed EICR plan would provide for lower payments for certain low-income borrowers, advocates have been harshly critical of several features of the proposal, including a complicated repayment formula that results in higher monthly payments for higher income earners, the exclusion of Parent PLUS borrowers and graduate school borrowers, and the Department’s apparent failure to fix the ongoing problems with the existing IDR plans. Rulemakers on the Department’s negotiated rulemaking committee failed to reach consensus on the EICR proposal, making its future uncertain. //The Department also released a proposal to eliminate certain interest capitalization triggers, including triggers related to leaving an IDR plan or failing to receritfy income on time. Rulemakers reached consensus on those plans, but enactment would not occur until July 2023, and the benefits would not be retroactive. //Big Changes Coming To Student Loan Repayment In 2022//4 Signs That Student Loan Cancellation Isn’t Off The Table//Want Student Loan Forgiveness?

[+] direction for the government to provide a better level of service. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)//Customer service and the government … do they belong in the same sentence? Some may even say it’s an oxymoron. Our most recent customer service and CX research study included the following question://It didn’t surprise me that the majority of the 1,000 Americans surveyed said, “No.” After all, the government is known for difficult processes, slow response times and bureaucratic red tape that frustrate its “customers,” also known as citizens of the United States. The numbers came in with 62% negative responses, which means 38% felt that the government does deliver an acceptable level of service. //That said, we just completed an informal survey on LinkedIn asking the same question. Let me emphasize the word “informal,” as we just threw it out to the LinkedIn community. The results …//Ouch! Still, there may be some light at the end of the tunnel. //On December 13, 2021, just about three weeks ago, President Joe Biden signed an Executive Order that is a big step in the right direction for the government to provide a better level of service. This isn’t just lip service. The order contains very specific language about 17 federal agencies, with 36 “commitments” to improve the level of service. //According to the White House briefing, President Biden is “taking decisive action to promote fiscal stewardship by improving the government’s service delivery to its customers, the American people.” Just as the best companies and brands that are known for delivering excellent customer service, putting their customers at the center of everything they do, the Executive Order “directs Federal agencies to put people at the center of everything the government does.” //Some of the agencies the Executive Order impacts include the most customer/citizen-facing entities such as the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security, Passport services, the Department of Veterans Affairs, student aid and more. //The government issued a fact sheet that shares some of the most promising improvements. Here are a few examples://·        Internal Revenue Service: There are 240 million individuals and businesses who file tax returns, and 167 million call the IRS for help. According to the fact sheet, filers will now save time by having the option to schedule a customer support callback. This brings the IRS help line into the 2020s. //·        Traveling: Americans who travel will be able to renew their passports online, saving time and effort. Passengers will have shorter security and check-in lines due to improved technologies.//·        Retirement: The 54.1 million Americans over 64 (with approximately 4 million more each year) will be able to claim benefits online, check the status of their applications and more. Additionally, Medicare recipients will have online tools that save costs on drugs and streamline the enrollment process with the Social Security Administration.//·        Student Loans: Forty-five million Americans are managing student loans. The new system will be made easier by providing a “single repayment portal” on StudentAid.gov, eliminating the need to visit multiple websites to manage loans. //·        Updating Personal Information: More than 30 million people move each year. Rather than having to go to multiple government agency websites, they will now only have to visit one site that will share the information across multiple federal and state agencies. The same goes for the approximately 2 million people who change their names each year.//·        And much more!//The government is moving full speed ahead in adopting technology that will create an easier and more convenient experience for its citizens. However, it’s important to note that technology is not always the answer. Just as I preach to our clients who want to create the best experience possible for their customers, the same applies to the government: technology is great, until it isn’t. No matter how good you think the technology is (and it may be) if there is a glitch, a problem, a question or someone just wants a little help, there needs to be a human-to-human option that is easy to get to. //For example, the technology the IRS is using to allow callers to set an appointment for a callback is the perfect solution to long hold times. Consider that someone who is frustrated calls and is forced to wait on hold for an unreasonable amount of time. That creates even more frustration. The ability to set a time for a callback will help eliminate the frustration and time that would be wasted waiting for an IRS agent to pick up. The point is that technology and human-to-human interaction can work together to create a better experience. //Furthermore, once someone does reach a government employee, that employee must be properly trained. The effort that they are making in the technological world must be in tandem with an effort to give government employees the training they need to address customers/citizens in a way that is helpful and fosters a positive reputation. //It may take some time, but if President Biden is serious about a customer service initiative, we’ll see the results of the survey question start to reverse. (And if anyone from the government involved in this initiative wants to talk, just let me know. I’m ready to serve!)//", 9.6%

(Photo by Robert Alexander/Getty Images)//1-8-22 — The story was updated with a statement from the National Safety Council.//There is a lot riding on the outcome of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision whether to allow the implementation of President Joe Biden’s vaccination mandates for employers with more than 100 workers. The Court heard two hours of oral arguments about the legality of the requirements on Friday. //The employer mandates would impact more than 80 million employees or about two-thirds of the U.S. workforce. If the Court allows the requirements to be implemented, the employers will need to://////National employment litigator David Gordon with Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp said that, “By January 10, large employers must have a plan in place to address the OSHA rule, and they must also have identified who is unvaccinated. //“It is unclear whether these obligations will be the subject of a brief stay. For now, employers must assume as if, on Monday, they will be subject to these requirements. Likewise, unless the court grants a brief stay while it decides the broader issues, all unvaccinated employees, as of Monday, must be masked while at work.”//There was no indication when the Court would issue a ruling.//Lorraine Martin, president and CEO of the National Safety Council, said in a statement that, “Covid-19 is the greatest workplace safety challenge in generations. The way we see it, employers shouldn’t wait on the courts to tell them what to do—they should implement these [mandates] because that’s the best way to keep workers safe and businesses operational.”//Opponents of the mandates told the Court they would cost businesses billions of dollars, impose administrative hardships on companies and organizations and force many people to quit their jobs.//CNN noted that, “Critics of the requirements, including a coalition of business groups and Republican-led states, say the Biden administration exceeded its authority in issuing such sweeping mandates....The administration, on the other hand focuses on the impact of the virus that has already killed some 800,000 Americans, closed businesses and kept children out of classrooms.”//U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices that Biden’s mandates would save 6,500 lives and prevent 250,000 hospitalizations in the next six months, and that exposure to Covid-19 is the biggest threat to workers in OHSA’s history.//According to Jeffrey Swartz, a constitutional law professor at Western Michigan University’s Cooley Law School, “The standard for maintaining or granting [a] stay is that there is no reasonable likelihood that the government will prevail on the issues at trial.  The government was able to provide evidence sufficient to show why they would succeed in court if the case went to trial, and their reasoning was enough to justify why the stay should be lifted.//“The issues here are far reaching relating to actions taken by administrative agencies. Most Americans have no idea how much we rely upon these agencies. They are able to promulgate rules in a much more rapid manner that the slow ponderous congressional ‘regular order’ and political disputes,” he said.//Nicholas Creel, an assistant professor of business law at Georgia College and State University observed that, “Chief Justice Roberts seemed very skeptical that the government was unable to enforce this rule, implying that the government could theoretically have been more aggressive in fighting the virus but choose not to. //“Further, Roberts was blatantly unswayed [by arguments] that the Post Office requesting a delay in the mandate’s implementation was evidence of it being problematic. Specifically, Roberts quipped that ‘’Just because the Post Office can’t do it efficiently doesn’t mean private industry can’t.’//“With Roberts often being a pivotal swing vote on this Court, this augurs well for those supporting the mandate,” Creel said.//He said that questions by Justices Breyer and Sotomayor implied “... that the Court understands that the alleged harms from the mandate going into force, such as mass resignations, are unlikely to materialize in the immediate term. This in turn makes it all the more likely that the mandate will be allowed to go into force this Monday as planned while the Court continues to debate the underlying issues.”//Creel said that one of the most notable statements in today’s arguments came from Justice Sotomayor, when she said that the OSHA rule was ‘not a vaccine mandate’ but was instead a mask and testing mandate for those who choose not to vaccinate.  //He observed that, “Justice Barrett was seemingly hinting at this logic as well when she asked the attorney challenging the rule if he thought OSHA could enforce a masking and/or testing mandate. It will be very unsurprising to see this distinction spotlighted in any opinion denying relief to those seeking to block the mandate. “//Creel pointed out that, “In seeking a stay to prevent the mandate from going into force, the attorneys challenging the rule claimed that between 1-3% of employees will quit their jobs if subjected to this mandate. //“The liberal Justices, Breyer especially, seemed to accept this result as likely but were nevertheless unpersuaded that the potential economic disruption caused by the mandate would outweigh the public’s interest in increasing vaccination rates.”// Gavin Villareal, a partner with law firm Baker Botts, said that, “While the argument was nominally about whether to grant an immediate stay, we saw the Justices struggling with who gets to decide if vaccinations should be required for American workers, the states or the federal government, and if the latter, whether Congress has specifically authorized the broad-reaching approach OSHA has taken its vaccination and testing in the Emergency Temporary Standard.//He said that, “In general, the conservative Justices seem to believe that OSHA exceeded its authority and the liberal Justices that OSHA had acted pursuant to adequate Congressional direction.”//Labor and employment attorney Matt Gomes said,” I think that all of the justices acknowledge that this is a difficult situation. They are all aware of the grave threat to public health. //“Even the conservative Justice Alito acknowledged that vaccination is the best way to combat the pandemic. However, they struggled with the question whether this Emergency Temporary Standard is the best way to accomplish the goal of incentivizing people to get vaccinated,” he said.//", 8.7%
"Biden Says There’s ‘No Option’ But To Abolish Senate Filibuster For Voting Rights — Here’s What That Means", "President Joe Biden threw his support Tuesday behind at least partially changing Senate rules to abolish the filibuster when it comes to voting rights—his biggest endorsement for the rule change yet—escalating Democrats’ showdown with Republicans over passing voting rights legislation.//President Joe Biden threw his support Tuesday behind at least partially changing Senate rules to abolish the filibuster when it comes to voting rights—his biggest endorsement for the rule change yet—escalating Democrats’ showdown with Republicans over passing voting rights legislation.//President Joe Biden speaks in support of changing the Senate filibuster rules at Morehouse College ... [+] and Clark Atlanta University on Jan. 11 in Atlanta. //The Senate has “no option” but to abolish the filibuster for voting rights legislation specifically if Republicans refuse to back it with the filibuster still in place, Biden said during a speech Tuesday in Georgia, describing the congressional chamber as a “shell of its former self.”//That means voting rights bills could pass with a simple majority of votes in the Senate, rather than the 60 votes that are typically needed to pass non-spending bills.//Biden emphasized the necessity of passing voting rights legislation to “defend our democracy” during his speech, saying senators “will have to declare where they stand, not just for the moment, but for the ages” with their vote on voting rights and “history has never been kind” to those who stand in favor of voter suppression.//Democrats are trying to pass the sweeping Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act, both of which have already passed the House but were thwarted in the Senate due to the filibuster rules.//The bills will come back up for a Senate vote in the coming days, which Biden said Tuesday “will mark a turning point in this nation’s history.”//Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has said the chamber will move forward with changing the filibuster rules by Martin Luther King Day, January 17, if Republicans don’t back the voting rights bills.//“The filibuster’s been weaponized and abused,” Biden said Tuesday. “State legislators can pass anti-voting laws with simple majorities. If they can do that, then the United States Senate should be able to protect voting rights by a simple majority.”//How the showdown in the Senate will play out—and if Democrats will even all get behind an effort to nix the filibuster for voting rights. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday Republicans will take actions “that are more inconvenient for the majority and this White House than what anybody has seen in living memory” if Democrats get rid of the filibuster, and there’s no indication yet that GOP senators would be willing to pass voting rights legislation with it still in place. Moderate Democrats Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) have also long been opposed to getting rid of the filibuster, and it remains unclear whether the White House and other Senate Democrats would be able to persuade them to back the effort—which could mean an effort to change the Senate rules wouldn’t have enough Democratic support to pass.//Voting rights advocates largely boycotted Biden’s speech Tuesday because they say he’s not going far enough to address the crisis, with a coalition of activist groups releasing a statement last week that told the president not to come to Georgia if it’s just an “empty gesture.” Activist groups gave the president cautious praise for his speech and support for changing Senate rules Tuesday, but emphasized the president needed to follow it up with concrete action. “While President Biden delivered a stirring speech today, it’s time for this administration to match their words with actions, and for Congress to do their job,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement.//Biden has long been hesitant when it comes to nuking the filibuster, even as many other Democrats have advocated for it, but told ABC News in December he would support a carve-out for voting rights if it was “the only thing standing between” legislation passing or not passing. Voting rights has become a central issue as Republican state lawmakers have moved to pass restrictive voting laws in the wake of the 2020 election, largely passed in the name of “election integrity” after former President Donald Trump pushed baseless claims about election fraud. The Brennan Center for Justice reports at least 34 laws restricting voting passed in 19 states in 2021—including in major battleground states like Georgia, Florida and Texas—and more than 100 state bills limiting voting have either been pre-filed for 2022 or will carry over from 2021. The wide-ranging Freedom to Vote Act that Democrats are trying to pass would counteract many of these state-level restrictions through measures like mandating no-excuse absentee voting, same-day voter registration, shortening long voting lines and thwarting state efforts to ban giving water to those in line, among numerous other measures. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act would make it harder for certain states to enact restrictive voting laws by requiring them to get approval from the federal government in order to change them, restoring aspects of the Voting Rights Act that were previously gutted by the Supreme Court.//Biden Will Endorse Changing Senate Rules to Pass Voting Rights Legislation (New York Times)//Biden to make 'forceful' push for voting rights, filibuster changes in Georgia speech (ABC News)//Don’t come to Atlanta without a plan to pass voting laws, groups tell Biden, Harris (Atlanta Journal-Constitution)//Schumer Threatens Vote On Filibuster Changes Over Blocked Voting Rights Reform (Forbes)//What Might Democrats’ Voting Rights Bill Entail?

"How A White House Tweet May Doom Biden’s Workplace Vaccine Mandate", "Biden Chief of Staff Ron Klain may have accidently put a dagger through the heart of Biden's vaccine ... [+] mandate for large employers. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)//Biden Chief of Staff Ron Klain may have accidently put a dagger through the heart of Biden's vaccine ... [+] mandate for large employers. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)//With the new COVID variant spreading across the nation at a lightning rate, President Biden is trying to implement an emergency order mandating that employers with more than 100 employees require either full vaccination or weekly COVID-19 tests and masking for unvaccinated employees. The rule is supposed to take effect this Monday and the Supreme Court heard an emergency motion yesterday to stop it from taking effect. (Biden is also ordering other vaccine mandates, but they are much less sweeping and won’t be discussed here.)//Congress has never passed a law mandating vaccinations and this sharply divided Congress isn’t about to pass one, so where does President Biden claim to get the power for this mandate? The Justice Department says that Congress has delegated broad powers to the Occupational Heath and Safety Agency (OSHA) to protect worker safety, including the power to require worker vaccinations. Under the law OSHA is charged with ensuring worker safety and health “by developing innovative methods, techniques, and approaches for dealing with occupational safety and health problems.” To that end, Congress authorized the Secretary of Labor “to set mandatory occupational safety and health standards applicable to businesses affecting interstate commerce.” //Presidents have no independent power to regulate workplaces, so President Biden is arguing that he is merely executing the power that Congress delegated to him through these broadly worded statutes. These are the sort of questions the Court deals with all the time. President Trump was particularly fond of governing through executive orders and was willing interpret various statutes as giving him extremely broad authority to do so. As a result, federal courts frequently struck down his executive orders.//One of the reasons Trump’s executive orders fared so poorly was that he had an itchy trigger finger when it came to Twitter. His tweets often undermined the arguments his own lawyers were making before the courts. For example, Trump kept tweeting about implementing a travel ban on Muslims even as his lawyers were arguing that his executive order was no such thing.//Therefore, one would think that the Biden Administration would know better than to tweet out messages that undercut their legal arguments supporting their actions. In this case, Biden is arguing that he is merely implementing the will of Congress as expressed in the statutes discussed earlier in this piece. //Unfortunately, the Biden Administration has failed to learn from Trump’s mistakes. Shortly after Biden gave a major speech announcing the vaccine mandate, his chief of staff, Ron Klain, re-tweeted a news anchor’s remark that: “OSHA doing this vaxx mandate as an emergency workplace safety rule is the ultimate work-around for the Federal govt to require vaccinations.”//That was a huge mistake. During oral argument Chief Justice John Roberts specifically referenced the tweet in a negative manner. He grilled the government’s lawyer, saying: “It seems to me that it's that the government is trying to work across the waterfront and it's just going agency by agency. I mean, this has been referred to, the approach, as a work-around, and I'm wondering what it is you're trying to work around.” //What Roberts is clearly implying is that Biden is trying work around the will of Congress rather than implement it. That is a dagger directly through the heart of Biden’s argument. Of the conservative Justices on the Court, he is generally considered the most moderate, and he arguably has special weight as the Chief Justice. If Klain’s gloating tweet has cost the Biden Administration Justice Robert’s trust, that was a very costly error.//Beyond the three liberal Justices on the Court, this leaves the mandate with few likely defenders. During oral argument, the Court’s newest Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, asked skeptical questions about why the mandate applied to low-risk outdoor professions like grounds-keeping as well as riskier indoor jobs. Justice Neil Gorsuch talked a lot about the “major questions doctrine”, which says that Courts should give less leeway to government agencies when their decisions are likely to have a widespread impact on the economy. //It is important to remember that this case is not about whether the vaccine mandate is a wise or foolish policy. The case turns on whether the Biden Administration is merely executing federal laws passed by Congress or unconstitutionally acting on its own. By calling its policy a “work around” the Biden Administration has cut its own feet out from under itself.//", 12.7%
