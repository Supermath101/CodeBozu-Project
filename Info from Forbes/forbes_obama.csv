"Obama Endorses Changing Filibuster To Pass Voting Rights In First Op-Ed Since Leaving Office", "In his first op-ed since leaving office in 2016, former President Barack Obama called for a shift in Senate filibuster rules so the Democratic majority may pass voting rights legislation he says will help Americans “overcome the gridlock and cynicism that’s so prevalent right now.”  //In his first op-ed since leaving office in 2016, former President Barack Obama called for a shift in Senate filibuster rules so the Democratic majority may pass voting rights legislation he says will help Americans “overcome the gridlock and cynicism that’s so prevalent right now.”  //ATLANTA, GA - JULY 30: Former U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during the funeral service of the ...

John Lewis, the civil rights fighter for whom the voting rights bill is named—the former president spoke at his memorial service two years ago.//Biden on Tuesday said the Senate has “no option” but to abolish the filibuster as it pertains to the voting rights bills — the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act — which have passed in the House but have stalled in the Senate. If the filibuster rules are changed, the bills could be passed with a simple majority rather than 60 votes. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the Senate will debate and vote on changing the filibuster rules on Martin Luther King Jr. Day next Monday, January 17, if Republicans don’t agree to a vote before then. If passed, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act aims to restore the original Voting Rights Act of 1965, increasing transparency by giving public notice of any changes in voting policies. The For The People Act would increase absentee and online voting accessibility.  // “At a time when democracy is under attack on every continent, we can’t hope to set an example for the world when one of our two major parties seems intent on chipping away at the foundation of our own democracy,” Obama wrote.//Moderate Senate Democrats Joe Manchin (D-W.Va) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) have said in the past they are not in favor of reforming the filibuster to pass the voting rights legislation. “A spokesperson for Cinema told Politico last month she “continues to support the Senate's 60-vote threshold, to protect the country from repeated radical reversals in federal policy which would cement uncertainty, deepen divisions, and further erode Americans’ confidence in our government.”//", 8.1%

Reid, a boxer in his teenage years, was Nevada’s longest-serving member of Congress, having held his Senate seat from 1987 to 2017.

"Drinking Bombay Sapphire With Fashion Designer Romeo Hunte", "Fashion Designer Romeo Hunte//Fashion Designer Romeo Hunte//Romeo Hunte is a fashion designer with the spirit of a great mixologist. His designs fuse different materials into something spectacular — whether a trench coat mixed into a leather biker jacket, or a traditional black blazer with one side only covered in long crystal strands. Celebrities have taken notice, with entertainers like Beyonce and Zendaya, sport stars like James Harden and Dwyane Wade and even Michelle Obama wearing his clothing. I spoke with Hunte about his recent collaboration with Bombay Sapphire, presenting holiday window displays with live performers in New York's SoHo, his signature cocktail creation and what he considers the special combination that drives his brand's success. //You turned down athletic scholarships to go to the Fashion Institute of Technology Was it hard to choose one skill over the other?//I'm comfortable in both worlds. Growing up in Brooklyn, I was a DJ, I used to breakdance this style called FlexN, but I was also known for having an appreciation for fashion. And as much as I was athletic, I still had my eye on fashion. There was always that connection. I taught myself how to sketch and how to keep up with collections. //How would you describe your style?//I pay attention to my clients and I try to fill that void in their closets. Add something that is not there, that hasn't been done. All my pieces have to serve a purpose. Someone may feel one of my outfits is just for the street, but no, it's a head-turner when you wear it on the red carpet or at a black tie event. It's all how you rock the piece. I want to create pieces that push fashion forward, something that builds a conversation. //How did your collaboration with Bombay Sapphire come about?//Bombay reached out. They were looking for creative talent and we both agreed to shine a light on SoHo and bring some excitement. Use live models, amazing artists and dance and create energy as people walked by. Having people look at windows again and bring back something special to the holiday season. //Are you a cocktail fan?//I'm a social drinker. I'll most likely have a cocktail if I'm meeting with someone after a long day of work or traveling. I drink wine more at home. //What's your favorite cocktail?//The one I created for Bombay is my signature go-to drink: the What's Good (see recipe below). Which is my way of saying, hi, how are you doing? It's an amazing cocktail to relax to, especially when I'm traveling. It's got Bombay, ginger beer, a splash of cranberry and a lime garnish. //Romeo Hunte with his cocktail What's Good//And for wines?//My go-to is a Malbec. I like a rich body. I drink reds when it's freezing outside to keep warm. I ventured into wine tasting when I started going to art classes, it's a great way to relax and open your mind. With whites, I'm more of a Chardonnay kind of guy. I'm a big fan of Maison Noir Wines.//You have a huge celebrity following. Is that what you need to grow a brand or is that just the icing?//Honestly it started when my business started. I began as a personal shopper and had a lot of VIP clients so those were the first people I designed for. Beyonce was one, so of course I had to make something for her. As my career grew I've been fortunate to work with a number of actors and athletes like James Harden, Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul. These guys shop luxury stores but they didn't want to wear the same brands everyone else was wearing — I have a combination of street, classic and swagger that fills that void in their closet. //You've also designed for Michelle Obama. //I love her — and I'm still creating amazing pieces, stay tuned! Working with her was an amazing experience. Something my daughter will always look up and say 'my dad did that.' I made a hybrid half-denim half-blazer jacket that she wore on the Ellen DeGeneres show to release her book. It's a little outside her everyday wardrobe, it's more chill, and that's one of her favorite jackets. Tailoring and street, that's the identity of Romeo Hunte.//Do you get nervous designing for someone famous or love the challenge?//I don't think I ever get nervous. The first thing that comes to my mind is 'I want to kill this.' Any project I do, I want them to step in my world but I step into their world as well and the balance always works.//After the designing is done, do you get to enjoy cocktails with some of your clients?//Yeah, of course. Like at the Met Gala we all get to drink together. It's a great moment to see everyone unwind. This year it was very interesting, something was in the air. A lot of my clients came up to me and said congratulations, you are killing it. It wasn't my first Met Gala but it was the most special one. //Romeo Hunte's WHAT’S GOOD cocktail://1.5 oz Bombay Sapphire//3 oz Ginger Beer//2 oz Cranberry Juice //Build ingredients in your favorite balloon glass or collins glass and garnish with a lime wedge.//", 18.8%

They visit L.A. as part of a five city tour which has seen them at the Brooklyn Museum and Art Institute of Chicago, with upcoming stops at Atlanta’s High Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, before returning to their permanent home at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.//The Obama Portraits are a mega-watt attraction, a two-painting show generating blockbuster audiences from coast-to-coast. The leading couple’s overwhelming charisma has a tendency to place anything near them in a dark shadow.//At LACMA, however, a third star–literally and figuratively–holds up to the Obama’s brilliance: Bisa Butler’s quilted portrait of the late Chadwick Bosman, Forever (2020). //Kehinde Wiley’s portrait of President Barack Obama and Amy Sherald’s portrait of First Lady Michelle Obama have taken their place among American art’s most important examples. Butler’s Forever will reside there too, in time, a Warhol Marilyn for a new generation.//Bisa Butler, Forever, 2020, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, gift of D'Rita and Robbie Robinson.//Forever, which belongs to LACMA’s permanent collection, is on view in “Black American Portraits,” an exhibition running concurrently to the Obama Portraits.//“‘Black American Portraits” was initially conceived as a companion exhibition to ‘The Obama Portraits Tour.’ Both exhibitions extend and express the importance of the representation of figures of color by artists of color through portraiture,” Christine Y. Kim, Curator, Contemporary Art, LACMA, told me. “‘Black American Portraits’ almost took on a life of its own once we realized the vast potential of the project and the relationships between and among figuration, representation, history, audience, the collection, and the museum, as well as the importance of centering and celebrating Black joy, complexity, excellence, nuance, family, community and love.”//Nearly 140 works of art tell a dynamic story of Black life in America through “Black American Portraits.” Visitors journey through two centuries of Black self-representation from the exhibition's earliest work—the late-eighteenth-century Portrait of a Sailor (Paul Cuffe?)—to images of the Harlem Renaissance, Civil Rights and Black Power eras, and on to contemporary artists' reflections on 2020 and 2021.//Included are pieces by self-taught artists and several non-Black artist allies across a variety of mediums.//Contrary to many of the recent major touring exhibitions which have been developed to highlight the difficulty of the Black experience in America, Kim consciously chose for “Black American Portraits” to counter what she sees as “spectacles of Black pain.”//Kwame Brathwaite, Untitled (Carolee Prince Wearing Her Own Designs), 1964, Los Angeles County ... [+] Museum of Art, promised gift of Kim and Keith Allen-Niesen.//“In an era when images of Black pain and trauma–even for the purposes of exposing injustice–are ubiquitous and hypervisible, a different kind of invisibility is created: the complexity of individual life with an immense and immeasurable fullness of unique experiences, feelings, expressions, reflections, moments, memories, thoughts, relationships, evolution, connections and projections,” Kim explains of her motivation to accentuate the positive. //“Black American Portraits” offers portrayals honoring Black musicians, artists, writers, political figures, athletes, heroes and heroines–deceased and living–celebrities and everyday people, friends, neighbors and families. Black togetherness, love, abundance, dignity, complexity, excellence, pride, dynamism, strength and hope are highlighted.//A roll call of America’s most significant Black artists feature in the show: Elizabeth Catlett, Charles White, Kerry James Marshall, Carrie Mae Weems, Deborah Wills and Hank Willis Thomas, Deborah Roberts, Augusta Savage, Gordon Parks, Romare Bearden, Kwame Brathwaite and David Driskell. //David C. Driskell, Jazz Singer (Lady of Leisure, Fox), 1974.//Hollywood loves a sequel, and “Black American Portraits” can be considered a sequel–45-years in the making–to LACMA’s presentation of the David Driskell-curated "Two Centuries of Black American Art,” undoubtedly one of the handful of most important art exhibits over the past 50 years, perhaps the most.//“Driskell’s bicentennial exhibition ‘Two Centuries of Black American Art,’ which opened at LACMA in 1976, was a groundbreaking show that created a connective tissue around a variety of divergent and exciting practices of Black American artists at a time when the range was othered, unknown and certainly not celebrated,” Kim said of the Driskell exhibition which informed her curation of “Black American Portraits” throughout. //Driskell’s (1931–2020) show presented over 200 works made by 63 artists between 1750 to 1950, acknowledging the work of Black artists whose contributions to American art had largely been neglected. //What “Two Centuries of Black American Art” started, “Black American Portraits” (through April 17, 2022) continues by revealing the artistic genius of Black artists still too often overlooked, and by filling museum spaces with the stories and faces of Black subjects, still too often underrepresented. //Installation photograph, Black American Portraits, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, November 7, ... [+] 2021–April 17, 2022.//Anyone with an interest in the Obama Portraits or “Black American Portraits” would also surely enjoy “Family Album: Dannielle Bowman, Janna Ireland and Contemporary Works from LACMA,” a free exhibition exploring the work of artists of color who examine themselves and history through the visual language of family photographs. The show can be seen in LACMA’s off-site gallery at Charles White Elementary School (2401 Wilshire Blvd.) four miles east of the main museum, Saturdays from 1-4 PM through June 5, 2022. //Also not to be missed are another complimentary pair of exhibitions highlighting heavyweight contemporary artists at the California African American museum: Sanford Biggers “Codeswitch” through January 23, 2022 and LaToya Ruby Frazier’s “The Last Cruze” through March 20, 2022.//A name unfamiliar to most will be June Edmonds. The Laband Art Gallery at Loyola Marymount University presents a thrilling solo exhibition serving as a forty-year survey of the Los Angeles-based artist. “June Edmonds: Full Spectrum” displays more than forty pieces made between 1980 and 2021, representing the first opportunity to offer attention to the artist’s lifelong commitment to portraying Black positivity in her artistic practice.//Monica Ikegwu, Abby x Bright. //Band of Vices gallery shows off a pair of rising Black artists, Monica Ikegwu and Tommy Mitchell, at its Sacred House location (5351 West Adams Blvd., Los Angeles, 90016) for an exhibition exploring growing up Black in America through January 8, 2022. //Out-of-towners looking to partake in this art binge–or locals in need of a staycation–can book accommodation into downtown L.A.’s Hotel Figueroa, 95-years-young following an extensive, two-year renovation. //Built in 1926, Hotel Figueroa was originally intended for solo female travelers looking for a safe place to stay during a time where women were prohibited from traveling without a male chaperone. Nearly a century later, the hotel’s vision continues to be rooted through the female lens, with art programming spanning the mediums of photography, painting, mixed media, sculpture, sound and performance. //Upon arrival, guests immediately discover that women-made art is integrated across all spaces on the property—from the walkable Featured Artist Series Exhibit and newly launched Featured Artist Suite, to the hotel’s guest rooms and meticulously hand-painted elevator banks by local female artists. Most notably, the building’s exterior features a 14-story high custom fig motif designed by U.K.-based muralist Bella Gomez.//", 10.5%

[+] Court Auditorium of the White House in Washington, DC on December 23, 2021. (Photo by Nicholas Kamm / AFP) (Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images)//One of the most underappreciated policy changes in higher education the past five years was the gigantic giveaway from the Trump administration to for-profit colleges. //The scope of the largess was and has been appalling, as Trump and his appointees rolled back important safeguards for students, reversed policies requiring for-profit schools to prove they provided value and overtly interceded to rescue, resuscitate and rehabilitate predatory schools. The direct cost to taxpayers was in the billions, funds that went nearly directly to Wall Street investors. The indirect cost to students and the quality of our education system remains uncounted. //The impact of the damage caused by for-profit colleges – the often online, often predatory and loan inducing colleges that can afford to spend millions on advertising – is well documented. //And so, when Biden defeated Trump in 2020, higher education leaders expected his team to reverse the Trump reverses – redeploying some of the protections and quality measures that Obama had successfully and prudently implemented. //Most of us are still waiting. //Granted, we’re less than a year into Biden’s term and he has had other fish to fry, as the saying goes. But, so far, the needed recalibration we all expected has yet to materialize. Worse, what has materialized has been disappointing. //That is not to say Biden and his team have done nothing on for-profit colleges. In March and again in June, his administration did forgive the loans of students who attended some for-profit colleges. But these are loans that were already issued – the investors who ran the schools in question already got the money. //In truth, those loans should probably never have been issued. And Biden has done little, if anything at all, to stem the ongoing river of taxpayer dollars flowing to for-profit schools in the form of grants and subsidized student loans. That lack of action will only pile on the cases of loan forgiveness and add to student debt. In other words, forgiving the loans helped some past victims of for-profits but did nothing to limit it, now or in the future. //In October, Biden’s Federal Trade Commission did send stern warning letters to 70 of the big for-profit colleges such as DeVry University, Grand Canyon University, University of Phoenix and Walden University. The letters advised the schools they could be subject to fines and other penalties if they used false or deceptive ads regarding job prospects or employment demand. //That’s good too, but, yet again, it’s a warning. It’s not an actual change, not altering the landscape that for-profit colleges have learned to game or the environment that allows them to continue to scoop up tax-payer funded profit. //In another example, the ‘gainful employment rule’ – an Obama rule that made for-profit colleges prove their graduates could actually find jobs that justified attending their schools and enriching their investors – was rolled back under Trump. Also in October, Biden’s lawyers essentially said that Trump’s repeal of the rule, a massive boost for for-profit colleges, was fine.  //In an understatement, that’s not what many of us expected from Biden. //It’s disappointing because there are so many things Biden could do in this area – to limit the ongoing damage done by investor-run schools. //He could, for example, ask his agencies to regulate the troubling, cynical and deceptive practice of for-profit colleges trying to convert to and hide as non-profits. It’s a practice the Government Accountability Office describes as “insider benefit” deals and it says the 17 schools it tagged as potentially doing it received a staggering $1.8 billion in federal funds. //To help address the same problem, Biden could also ask the IRS to stop blindly approving applications from schools to become ‘non-profit.’ It’s confusing and litigious. The IRS can’t possibly tackle what is or is not a non-profit school, nor should they. //On the same problem, he can and should also have his Department of Education sit down with accrediting bodies – though officially independent, they get their power from the Department – and ask them to scrutinize and review these “insider benefit” deals and the colleges that are essentially run by for-profit companies while selling themselves as non-profits. Such colleges are generally referred to as captured non-profits. //And Biden should absolutely and immediately remove the accrediting authority of ACICS – the entity that “accredits” many of the country’s for-profits. Obama revoked their authority, citing a tragic history of complete largess. Trump reinstated it. Under Biden, ACICS is still operating. //Trying to be understanding of the other legitimate crises that Biden and his team are trying to address, keeping the pressure on these for-profits, the outlaws of legitimate education, may not feel like the top priority. And, in fairness, it’s probably not. But it is important. And most of what Biden could do, he can do without the aid or consent of Congress. //And so, while many of us wait, we wonder – are meaningful actions coming and just delayed? Or did we fool ourselves into thinking Biden would be at least as good as Obama at protecting students and ensuring the quality of colleges and the degrees they award?//", 7.5%

Separately, the Bezos family pledged $166 million to NYU Langone Medical Center. A spokesperson declined to specify if Bezos himself was involved in the NYU donation, but his parents, Mike and Jacklyn, are quoted in a press release announcing it.//The gifts come on the heels of $96 million in donations from Bezos last week to 32 organizations helping homeless families.//Bezos’s gift to the Obama Foundation is the largest it has ever received. In a press release, the foundation said the donation will honor the late civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, and as part of the gift, Bezos asked to name the plaza at the Obama Presidential Center, which is currently under construction on Chicago’s South Side, after the civil rights icon. //“Freedom fighters deserve a special place in the pantheon of heroes, and I can’t think of a more fitting person to honor with this gift than John Lewis, a great American leader and a man of extraordinary decency and courage,” Bezos said in a statement. “I’m thrilled to support President and Mrs. Obama and their Foundation in its mission to train and inspire tomorrow’s leaders.”//The Obama Foundation will use the money to “expand the scope” of programming focusing on leadership, including the foundation’s Girls Opportunity Alliance, My Brother’s Keeper and the Global Leaders Program. Courtney Williams, communications director for the Obama Foundation, said the foundation will receive $100 million in cash—not Amazon stock like last week’s donations.//Also on Monday, NYU Langone Hospital in Brooklyn said it received $166 million from the Bezos family. The donation will be used to address “social determinants of health and key drivers of health inequities,” NYU Langone said in a press release. Though Bezos’s parents were early investors in Amazon and have a foundation for their charitable giving, the NYU donation did not come from the Bezos Family Foundation, and instead came directly from the family.// The Bezos Family Foundation had $88 million in assets at the end of 2019, according to the most recently available IRS filing. //Since he stepped down as CEO of Amazon in July, Bezos has made a series of high-profile donations and pledges. This month alone, Bezos has given away 39,579 shares of Amazon worth about $144 million to nonprofits, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, but an Amazon spokesperson declined to say where those shares went. //In all, Bezos has given away less than 1% of his total net worth, according to Forbes estimates, and he hasn’t signed the Giving Pledge, a commitment to donate the majority of one’s wealth to charitable causes.//Last week, he gave $100 million to organizations helping homeless families through the Bezos Day One Fund, which he started in 2018 with a $2 billion commitment with his then wife, MacKenzie Scott. After touching down from his brief excursion into space over the summer, Bezos pledged $100 million each to chef José Andrés and political commentator Van Jones and promised another $200 million to the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum. //Forbes pegs Jeff Bezos’ net worth at about $207 billion as of midday EST on Monday. That puts him about $100 billion behind Elon Musk, who’s worth an estimated $307 billion.//Editor's note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the gift to NYU was from the Bezos Family Foundation; the gift was in fact from the Bezos family.//", 18.7%

That’s not unreasonable for them to be concerned about that,” Obama said. //“There are times when I feel discouraged, the future seems somewhat bleak, when I’m doubtful that humanity can get its act together before it’s too late,” Obama said. “Then images of dystopia start creeping into my dreams . . . whenever I feel such despondency, I remind myself that cynicism is the recourse of cowards. We can’t afford hopelessness.” //The U.S. and nearly 200 other countries signed in 2015 the Paris Agreement, which set a goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius below preindustrial levels, when Obama was president. Trump announced his intention to pull out of the deal in 2017, along with rolling back environmental regulations, although the U.S. did not formally leave until the last days of his time in office. Biden rejoined the Paris agreement in February, and has reversed many of the Trump-era environmental deregulations. //White House Says Trump Has Saved Environment. His Record Says Otherwise.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)//Biden said in a statement Califf has the experience and expertise to lead the agency through the coronavirus pandemic, adding that it is “mission critical that we have a steady, independent hand to guide the FDA.”//Califf, a cardiologist and clinical trial specialist, served as FDA commissioner for the last 11 months of former President Barack Obama’s term.//If confirmed by the Senate, Califf would oversee decisions at the agency including those related to Covid-19 vaccines, electronic cigarettes and prescription drugs.//Califf would be the first FDA commissioner to return for a second tour since the 1940s, according to the Associated Press.//The White House had a legal deadline of mid-November to find a permanent commissioner, which has been filled on an interim basis since January.//Califf received broad support during confirmation for his first stint as FDA commissioner, winning by an 89-4 margin. Califf began working at the FDA in 2015, and his 11-month term was highly influenced by revelations about pharmaceutical companies, including the opioid epidemic, the AP reports. He was one of the first FDA officials to acknowledge the agency’s missteps in oversight and regulation of prescription painkillers, calling for a sweeping review in 2016. “If addiction to opioids and misuse of opioids is an enemy then we at the FDA — like every other part of society — underestimated the tenacity of the enemy,” Califf told the AP in 2016. “So we’ve got to adjust.”//Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) opposed Califf’s nomination in 2016, and immediately said he would oppose his new nomination after it was announced Friday. He claimed changing the culture at the FDA is crucial to combating the opioid epidemic, and that Califf’s ties to the pharmaceutical industry “will take us backwards not forward.” “His nomination is an insult to the many families and individuals who have had their lives changed forever as a result of addiction,” Manchin said in a statement, urging the Biden administration to choose a new nominee. Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) also said in a statement she will “throughly review” Califf’s record following past decisions by the FDA, specifically on the approval and labeling of opioid medications.//Califf may face more scrutiny from Democrats this time around during confirmation, Politico notes, as he has served as a policy advisor for Google’s parent company, Alphabet, since 2019, in addition to working for the Duke Clinical Research Institute.//Dr. Janet Woodcock, the FDA’s drug director, has served as acting commissioner since January. She was expected to receive the nomination for the permanent position, but Democratic lawmakers took issue with the handling of opioid prescription painkillers during her 30-year tenure with the FDA, as well as the recent decision to approve a controversial Alzheimer’s drug, according to CNN.//Biden poised to nominate Califf as FDA chief (Politico)//FDA Commissioner Calls For Inspector General Probe Into Biogen Alzheimer’s Drug Approval (Forbes)//", 3.4%

[+] 2021, in Glasgow, Scotland. //Former U.S. President Barack Obama expresses his outrage during day nine of COP26 on November 8, ... [+] 2021, in Glasgow, Scotland. //Climate change should not be a partisan issue, former President Barack Obama said on Monday as he addressed attendees of the UN Climate Conference COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland.//In a speech reflecting on his legacy, America’s role in climate leadership, and the role of young activists in spearheading action, Obama also addressed the current political divide in the U.S.//“The U.S. appears to have a more vigorous hostility to climate than other places. That’s got to stop. Saving the planet is not a partisan issue,” Obama said, adding: “Climate change can’t be seen as an opportunity to score political points.”//Without directly naming his successor Donald Trump, or the Republican Party, Obama deplored their “active hostility” toward climate science. “It does not matter if you’re a Republican or a Democrat if your Florida house is flooded by rising seas, or your crops fail in the Dakotas or your California house burns down,” Obama said. “Science does not care about party affiliation.” //Earlier in the day, the former president addressed a panel focusing on “partnerships for island resilience: sharing solutions in the great Ocean States,” raising again the point of political processes standing in the way of progress. “Sometimes it may feel like the United States is not always moving as fast or following through on our commitments as much as we’d like. It’s not for lack of trying by the kinds of people that you’re working with. We’ve got our contentious battles. It’s one thing about democracy—it turns out you don’t always get your way,” he said.//Obama confirmed his attendance at the UN Climate Conference on November 4 but details of his engagements were only released on Sunday evening. The long line formed outside the plenary room where Obama spoke and the thunderous applause and cheers following him onstage signaled ongoing enthusiasm for the former U.S. president, who first committed the country to the climate targets of the Paris Agreement.//Obama jokingly downplayed his position at the beginning of his speech: “I am a private citizen now, so trips like these feel a bit different than they used to. I don’t get invited to the group photo; traffic is a thing again; music doesn’t play when I enter the room. On the other hand, I can give a speech like this without a tie on and not create a scandal back home—I hope.”//The former president expressed regret for not having done more to tackle climate change while in power, due to being deprived of a robust majority in Congress for most of his presidency—a situation he sees affecting President Joe Biden’s effort to pass meaningful legislation to support America’s green transition.//While expressing confidence that a version of Biden’s Build Back Better plan would pass Congress in the next few weeks, Obama also underlined the need for citizens committed to climate action, especially young people, to exercise their right to vote. “Cynicism is the recourse of cowards. We can’t afford hopelessness. Instead, we’ll have to muster the will and the passion and the activism of citizens to push governments to meet this challenge,” Obama said.//“Vote like your life depends on it—because it does. We will not have more ambitious climate plans coming out of governments unless governments feel some pressure from voters,” he added.//Specifically addressing young people fighting for climate action, Obama also cautioned them to listen to the concerns of those who fear the clean energy transition’s impact on their livelihood. “We have to understand their realities and work with them, so that serious action on climate change doesn’t adversely impact them,” he said. “Any climate plan worth its salt needs to take these inequities into account.”//", 12.5%

[+] during a groundbreaking ceremony for the Obama Presidential Center on Tuesday.//The Obamas chose the location, Jackson Park, partly because of its sentimental value, the former president said Tuesday⁠, describing Chicago as “where almost everything precious to me began.”//The Obama Presidential Center will be built within several miles of where Obama began his political career as a community organizer, the neighborhood Michelle grew up in, the reception hall where the two were married and the hospitals where their daughters Malia and Sasha were born, the former president said Tuesday.//Obama also said he wanted to build the presidential library in the area because of its proximity to “vibrant neighborhoods … where we believe we can make a difference.”//The former president expressed his hope that the center will be more than an archive and help “give back” to the South Side and Chicago by becoming a “living, thriving home” for the city’s culture.//Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot attended the ceremony.//The news that Obama’s presidential library would head to Chicago was first announced in 2015, after Obama’s birthplace of Honolulu, Hawaii, was also considered, although Chicago was Obama’s first choice. The $830 million center has proved controversial. In 2018, a group of environmentalists sued to block construction in Jackson Park and argued public land should not be used for a private project, a lawsuit that was later dismissed by a federal judge. Just last month, a second bid to stop the project’s groundbreaking was denied by a judge. Locals have also raised concerns about possible gentrification of surrounding neighborhoods as a result of the project. The center was slated to open this year, but was delayed by the lawsuits and the coronavirus pandemic. The complex will include a museum, the first fully-digitized presidential library, a new Chicago Public Library branch and green space.//", 2.3%
"How Joe Rogan, Alex Cooper, And The Obamas Are Helping Spotify Run Circles Around Apple", "Joe Rogan performs during his appearance at The Ice House Comedy Club on April 17, 2019 in Pasadena, ... [+] California.//Joe Rogan performs during his appearance at The Ice House Comedy Club on April 17, 2019 in Pasadena, ... [+] California.//CNN’s chief medical correspondent came right out and said it, only a few minutes into what would ultimately be a three-hour conversation with Joe Rogan earlier this month. “I like listening to you, Joe,” Dr. Sanjay Gupta declared, matter-of-factly, to the controversial podcast host across from him wearing a black Cypress Hill T-shirt. “I think you’re an authentic guy.”//Of course, it was more than bonhomie and an appreciation for Rogan’s authenticity that motivated the CNN health expert to sit down with the host who scored a $100 million deal last year from Spotify to move his audio and video podcast exclusively to the music streamer. Gupta confessed that he also wanted to reach Rogan’s audience — specifically, the audience that doesn’t watch CNN. “I thought to myself — if there’s one person, really, that I would have a conversation (with) and say, ‘Hey man, just listen to how I think about these things, and I want to hear about how you think’ ... who would that one person be in the United States? And it was Joe Rogan.” //“Mmmm,” a dubious Rogan replied.//“It was you.”//“... How weird,” the host continued, as episode #1718 of The Joe Rogan Experience got under way. An episode, by the way, that would eventually generate a slew of headlines, as the show often does — this time for the way Rogan ripped into Gupta for CNN’s coverage of Rogan admitting he took ivermectin after recently contracting the coronavirus.//Without rehashing the particulars of that conversation or the back-and-forth about what Rogan said about CNN (nor CNN’s official response, in which the network acknowledged “The only thing we did wrong was bruise (Rogan’s) ego”), it’s nonetheless important here to appreciate the gravitational pull that Rogan — and by extension, Spotify — exerts in the noisy, fractious media universe.//The streaming giant’s third quarter earnings announcement on Wednesday certainly underscored that aspect of Spotify’s identity, which sometimes gets overshadowed by its status as a music streaming powerhouse. At one point during Spotify’s earnings call, the company proclaimed that it “recently became” the top podcast platform in the US, used by the most listeners, according to the company’s internal tally as well as date from Edison Research. //“We fought hard to gain new listeners,” Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said during the call, about the company’s multi-year ramp-up of its podcast business. “And our success is not attributable to just one thing, but literally hundreds, if not thousands, of improvements that we’re working on in parallel for the benefit of creators, users, and advertisers alike.”//In hindsight, the Sweden-based streaming giant’s lateral move into podcasts years ago as an extension of its overall audio focus ended up being a brilliant move, ensuring that rivals couldn’t flank it as they raced to catch up on music streaming. Not that anyone should have been caught unaware at the fact that this has been Spotify’s ambition for a few years now, either. Indeed, a revelatory 2019 blog post from Ek himself laid out his vision for Spotify eventually becoming “the world’s number one audio platform.”//And why not? The global podcast industry alone is believed to be a $10 billion market, according to one analysis — and growing every year.//Earlier this month, Spotify’s chief content & advertising business officer Dawn Ostroff confirmed that the company now hosts more than three million podcasts (up from only about 185,000 in early 2019). Those include some of the service’s hottest commodities, like Rogan’s show, as well as the wildly popular Call Her Daddy podcast co-created by Alexandra Cooper. Spotify nagged that one a few months ago from Barstool Sports, securing Cooper with a more than $60 million deal to make Spotify the exclusive home of Call her Daddy.//And the deals haven’t stopped. Spotify also signed a $25 million deal with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Same with the Obamas, through their Higher Ground content studio. Journalist Jemele Hill, meanwhile, earlier this year expanded her existing podcast deal with Spotify to form her own podcast network — The Unbothered Network, the purpose of which is to elevate the stories of Black women.//“The Unbothered Network is more than just a content hub — it’s a space where Black women can hopefully see their full selves,” Hill said in a statement about the news.//Other recent podcast updates that Spotify has released include the launch of paid subscriptions in the US, as well as a few dozen new original and exclusive podcasts. Having multiple podcast studios — like The Ringer, Parcast, and Gimlet — under its banner also helps. Indeed, the company’s very strength, its expansive breadth of content, is actually anathema to Spotify’s closest rival in the podcast sphere — Apple.//The iPhone maker, of course, is a tech company that’s baked things like curation and an avoidance of mass appeal while pursuing narrow, specific markets, into its operational DNA. It also doesn’t help that Apple’s own Podcast app is objectively pretty terrible. The app has a middling 1.8/5 rating in Apple’s own App Store. “How can Apple,” one recent reviewer laments, “(one) of the first companies to realize how important user interface is, make such a convoluted and confusing app?”//Not that the company is sitting idly by and letting podcasts slip entirely from its grasp. Apple, too, has begun commissioning exclusive podcasts of its own, one critically acclaimed example of which is The Line. Apple has also introduced a subscription tier for Podcasts subscribers, into which more show exclusives will flow.//So far, though, it’s Spotify that keeps going from strength to strength in the podcast game.//I’ve seen one estimate that every episode of Rogan’s podcast alone reaches around 11 million people, making it the most popular in the US for most of the past two years. But with his size, along with the attendant success that redounds to Spotify, has also come the kinds of questions and concerns that go hand in hand with being a media company. //At a conference this month, for example, Ostroff had to affirm that, no, Spotify will not allow inaccurate information to be disseminated on its platform. Which is a line that Rogan tests regularly. Like in April, when he seemed to recommend that healthy young people not get the coronavirus vaccine. And when he said recently that he thinks President Biden might not have really gotten a booster shot, which was broadcast live.//“We have hit a weird place right now,” Rogan said during a recent episode of his show, in which he interviewed journalist Alex Berenson. A frequent guest on Tucker Carlson’s Fox show, Berenson is a coronavirus vaccine skeptic who has been banned from Twitter. In the opening moments of the Rogan episode, Berenson railed against “Pfizer and the lies that the CDC told people.” //“What’s really interesting,” Rogan replied, “is almost no anger (directed) at the lab in Wuhan … it’s almost like an inconvenient truth — that, most likely, this virus emerged from a lab.”//", 10.7%
