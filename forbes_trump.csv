[+] September 28, 2021, in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)//In 2021, Joe Biden disappointed Americans who expected him to reverse Donald Trump’s protectionist trade policies. Will 2022 bring better policies? To find out, I asked three leading trade experts. //“I expect a modest—very modest—liberalization of the steel and aluminum tariffs, via managed trade [TRQ or tariff-rate quota] agreements with other U.S. allies like Japan,” said Scott Lincicome, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Cato Institute. “These will probably look a lot like the U.S.-E.U. (European Union) deal, meaning some tariff liberalization for a select amount of imports but below historical levels and nothing anywhere close to free trade. I expect all of the China tariffs to remain, and it’s a coin flip as to whether Biden will extend the solar safeguard tariffs in early 2022. If I had to wager on the latter, I’d put my money on an extension. Other than that, I expect more of Biden’s protectionist 2021 on things like Buy America, the Jones Act and other trade-related industrial policy (e.g., in the Build Back Better bill).”//What about U.S. policy changes toward multilateral agreements? “I don’t ‘expect’ it but wouldn’t be shocked to see the Biden administration re-engage on CPTPP [Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership] after the November mid-terms,” said Lincicome. “Otherwise, maybe a little something at the WTO [World Trade Organization] but nothing groundbreaking.” //Other trade experts are only somewhat more optimistic. Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, does not expect the Biden administration to take many steps to remove protectionist trade policies. “They may substitute a more reasonable or useful set of targets for China trade than the so-called ‘Phase One’ agreement,” he said. “They may find other places to substitute quotas for tariffs as they did on steel and aluminum with the European Union. All that says they want managed trade, and will not rollback protection, even if they slightly improve its form.”//On the international front, Posen sees some possibilities for liberalization. “There are a few places where I think the Biden administration may encourage trade liberalization indirectly by pursuing other policies,” he said. “The implementation of the international corporate minimum tax should remove some major distortions to trade and some legitimate claims of injustice. Positive steps on decarbonization would remove a justification for future trade barriers. //“National security goals may push the Biden administration to encourage expansion of CPTPP (excepting China) and of E.U. relations East and South. The economy running hot with rising interest rates will diminish incentives for aggressive currency manipulation by others against the dollar. This might also lay the groundwork for a future U.S. administration to face less hostility to trade liberalization.”//“It would be a pleasant surprise if the Biden administration began to remove protectionist policies instituted during the Trump administration,” said Bryan Riley, director of the National Taxpayers Union’s Free Trade Initiative. “Last year, President Biden maintained the Trump administration’s ineffective tariffs on imports from China, modified instead of eliminating restrictions on steel and aluminum imported from allies, and watched from the sidelines as other countries lined up to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That's a slow start, to say the least.”//Riley does not expect major movement on trade from the Biden administration in 2022. “The Biden administration is likely to keep trade policy on the back burner. If inflation fears mount, perhaps that will lead to some modest liberalization, but I wouldn't bet on it. Congress may take action on the Generalized System of Preferences, which lowers tariffs on some imports from low-income countries, and the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill, which cuts tariffs on some imports used by U.S. manufacturers,” he said. “But it may also approve new subsidies for favored industries and embrace a government-led industrial policy.”//Riley thinks there is a chance that if Republicans take control of Congress “perhaps legislators will push back against Biden's tariffs in a way they were unwilling to do during the Trump administration.” Still, looking ahead, the future of free trade in the Republican party remains uncertain. “The big question is whether the next Republican presidential candidate will be President Trump or someone similar, or someone who better understands the importance of trade for America's future,” said Riley.//As 2022 began, the U.S. government remained mostly absent from important international trade developments. “China joins U.S. allies including Japan and Australia in a new Asia-Pacific trade agreement that launches Saturday—with the U.S. watching from the sidelines,” reported the Wall Street Journal, “The new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, will eventually eliminate more than 90% of tariffs on commerce among its 15 member countries, in what economists say will be a boon to trade in the region.”//To most trade experts, it appears that while other countries are busy playing chess, U.S. leaders are playing checkers—and may even respond to world events by placing more tariffs on chess sets.//", 12.4%

Orbán claims his policies support what he calls an “illiberal democracy.”//The American political right has displayed a growing fascination with Orbán and his nationalist policies, especially after Fox News host Tucker Carlson held his show in Hungary for a week in August and sat down with Orbán for an interview. Orbán lauded Trump, telling Carlson he is a “great friend of Hungary” and saying he backs Trump’s “America first” policy as part of a broader support for right-wing nationalism worldwide. Trump's cozy relationship with Orbán and other strongman leaders like Bolsonaro, in contrast with his strained relationship with figures like Germany’s Angela Merkel and Canada’s Justin Trudeau, came as a worrying sign for pro-democracy advocates.

I say, let them have it because America sees through theirs (sic) lies and polarizations."//Trump's role in inciting the riot and what, if any, consequences should be appropriate have been hotly debated over the past year. Trump's speech to his supporters prior to the riot, urging them to march toward the Capitol, was directly cited as grounds for the “incitement of insurrection” charge that led to his impeachment on January 13—a historic occurrence since it made him the first president to be impeached twice and was the most bipartisan impeachment vote in history. The Senate later acquitted him, though seven Republican senators broke ranks and voted for his conviction. Trump and his allies have also been at the center of the House committee's investigation into the January 6 riot. Dozens of former Trump Administration officials have been subpoenaed by the committee, along with advisors like Roger Stone and extremist groups loyal to Trump like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. Trump and many of his former officials have tried to block the committee from obtaining White House records, claiming they are protected by executive privilege. //5.

Less than half (48%) of respondents said they believe there was either no or very little voter fraud, however, and 52% of Trump voters and 45% of Republicans falsely believe there was widespread voter fraud that changed the election result—something for which there is no evidence to support.//A 62% majority of respondents in the CBS/YouGov poll predicted there will be violence in response to future elections, and 68% said January 6 was a sign of “increasing political violence.”//Hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building on January 6 following a rally by Trump and his allies, as Congress was set to certify President Joe Biden’s win in the 2020 presidential election. The riot—which resulted in five deaths, over 100 law enforcement injuries and $1 million worth of damage to the Capitol building, per NPR—has so far led to more than 700 people being charged with crimes linked to the attack and more than 50 so far being sentenced to punishments that range from community service to jail time. //A House committee is now investigating the January 6 attack, which has so far resulted in a slew of subpoenas, interviews and document requests to those linked to the riot and the events leading up to it. The Morning Consult poll, conducted December 18-20, found Americans’ patience with the committee may be wearing thin, however, with the committee’s approval rating falling from 53% to 46% between July and December.

"Trump’s SPAC Could Rocket To A $10 Billion Plus Valuation With No Revenue", "Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino 39-Story Tower Implodes//Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino 39-Story Tower Implodes//On December 6 the Digital World Acquisition Corporation, which has stock symbol DWAC, the SPAC that is merging with President Trump’s newly formed media company, included an investor presentation in an SEC filing (scroll the bottom of the filing). One of the most important charts in it (slide 5) shows assumptions for how many shares could be outstanding if the merger is completed and a $1 billion PIPE or Private Investment in Public Equity is closed.//The reason this is so important is because currently there are 37.2 million shares outstanding but they could balloon to 193 to almost 225 million, depending on which stock price and earnout scenario plays out. //Outstanding shares scenarios for DWAC//Market cap would skyrocket//DWAC’s closing price on Thursday was $51.91. Using the 37.2 million shares this would value Trump’s TMTG or Trump Media & Technology Group at $1.9 billion.//However, using the 193 and 225 million share counts shown in the slide, DWAC’s market cap would skyrocket to $10 to $11.7 billion, respectively.//Companies that have market caps between $10 and $11.7 billion in ascending order include Levi Strauss, Suncorp, Invesco, Singapore Airlines, Lear, Alcoa, Hertz, Grubhub, DraftKings, Avis and American Airlines per CompaniesMarketCap.com. And these companies, which generate hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in revenue, have very large organizations and many have been around for decades, which demonstrates what it typically takes to get to a $10 billion valuation.//Huge market cap with no to little revenue//The investor presentation also includes a slide, the last one, with estimates for TRUTH Social and TMTG+’s number of users or subscribers, how many could be monetized for TRUTH Social and ARPU or Average Revenue Per User for both offerings. It then shows how much total revenue these would generate. Note that TMTG+ is expected to generate the lion share of revenue. The two key TMTG+ assumptions are://////Total revenue would start at $114 million in 2023, essentially the first year of generating revenue, and grow to $3.7 billion in 2026, its fourth full year.//President Trump's Media Groups revenue projections//Note that while these projections are compared to current, well-known companies, in other parts of the presentation, they are subject to major revisions and in my experience will more likely move down than up. Also note that the beta version for Truth Social was supposed to be available in November but as of December 30 the website was asking people to join a waiting list.//The shares have settled around $50//After the initial rush of excitement about DWAC merging with Trump’s social media company where the shares hit an intra-day high of $175 on October 22, they have seemed to have settled down in the low $50’s for almost three weeks. They have even increased from $45 on December 3, the day before the PIPE deal was announced with a conversion price of $33.60.//If the shares can hang around $50 DWAC and therefore Trump’s media company would be valued between $10 to almost $12 billion with no revenue.//DWAC stock price//", 12.2%

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)//On Monday, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) formally resigned from the United States Congress. Nunes, who had announced his departure last month, is set to become the chief executive officer (CEO) of former President Donald Trump's new social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), which has been billed as an alternative to "Big Tech."//Nunes' resignation letter was read aloud on the House floor during Monday's pro forma session and was set to take effect at 11:59 pm.//"The honorable, the speaker, House of Representatives, madam, I write to inform you that I have notified California Gov. Gavin Newsom of my resignation from the U.S. House of Representatives effective today at 11:59 p.m." Nunes' letter read. "It has been the honor of my life to represent the people of California's San Joaquin Valley for the last 19 years."//Nunes had served in Congress for 10 terms before his resignation, but it has been reported that California's redistricting process may have played a role in his decision to leave the House. According to TheHill.com, an initial proposed map had him shifting from a fairly safe Republican-leaning district to one where Democrats may have the advantage. Nunes had also previously served as a member of President Donald Trump's transition team.//House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) selected longtime Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) to serve as the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee to replace Nunes.//TRUTH Social//Last month, TMTG reportedly raised $1 billion in private investment in public equity (PIPE) funding, while it also announced that it had entered into a wide-ranging technology and cloud services agreement with online video platform Rumble, which will now operate part of the TRUTH Social network as well as TMTG+.//Reaction to Nunes' resignation was noted on social media on Monday afternoon.//"Devin Nunes is no longer a member of Congress.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)//On December 6 Digital World Acquisition Corporation or DWAC, the SPAC that is merging with President Trump’s newly formed media company, included an investor presentation in an SEC filing (scroll the bottom of the filing). One of, if not the most important chart in it, is the last one showing revenue projections from 2022 to 2026. The reason it is so important, besides estimating revenues, users and average revenue per user, or ARPU, is that it helps to justify a stock price that has skyrocketed since the merger was announced. //In the last slide titled “Revenue Projections” there are assumptions for TRUTH Social, the Twitter style social media site, and TMTG+, a subscription service similar to Netflix or FOX Nation, an offer that I believe will need to be included. The slide contains estimated number of users or subscribers, how many could be monetized for TRUTH Social and ARPU for both offerings. The graph also shows how much total revenue these would generate.//President Trump's Media Groups revenue projections//TRUTH Social doesn’t generate much revenue //TRUTH Social looks to take on social media sites such as Facebook/Meta and Twitter. From zero users it forecasts 16 million next year growing to 81 million in 2026. As a point of reference the first tweet was on March 21, 2006, and it took five years to get to 85 million users. Twitter currently has about 400 million total users, of which 211 million are monetized, or 53%. Note that only 37 million of the 211 million, or 18%, are monetized in the U.S.//Subscriber and usage growth for Netflix, podcasts, Twitter and Disney+//TRUTH Social is planning on only monetizing 5% of its users in 2022 but that takes a significant jump to 25% in 2023 and levels off at 26% from 2024 to 2026. That means Truth Social would be monetizing the equivalent of 49% of Twitter’s U.S. monetization rate.//It plans to start generating revenue from the service in 2022 at $5.90 per monetizable user and grow that to $13.50 in 2026. //The graph in the Investor Presentation only shows revenue of $1 million in 2022 with all of it coming from TRUTH Social. It looks like TRUTH Social would not generate any revenue until the very end of the year.//When looking at 2026 TRUTH Social plans to have 21.1 million monetizable users at $13.50 per user at the end of the year. When using an average of total users between 2025 and 2026, percent monetized and ARPU, TRUTH’s revenue would be $258 million for the year. //Total revenue in 2023 is projected to be $114.1 million and $3.665.3 million in 2026. As a percent of TMTG’s total revenue, TRUTH Social would be about 26% in 2023, dropping to 7% in 2026. Its growth is projected to slow from 326% in 2024 to 23% in 2026.//TMTG+ will need a lot of content to carry the load//With TRUTH Social only providing 7% of TMTG’s total revenue in 2026, TMTG+ will have to deliver by licensing and creating content. And there will have to be a lot of it.//TMTG+ plans to build a recurring revenue business similar to Netflix or I believe something similar to FOX Nation as studio delivered shows cost less to produce than series or one-time feature films. Studio shows are also much easier to change if they are not delivering the engagement that will be needed. //TMTG+ doesn’t plan to have any paying subscribers until 2023 when it starts with 4 million. It then projects growth to 40 million in 2026. As a point of reference Netflix was founded in 1997 and started its streaming business in 2007. It took six years, until 2013, for it to have 40 million paid subscribers and it had a huge customer base to leverage.//Note that Netflix had an average of about 70 million U.S. paid subscribers in 2020 that generated $11.46 billion in revenue. This equates to $13.64 per month per subscriber.//TMTG+ forecasts that it can charge $5.56 per month per subscriber in 2023 and grow that to $9.00 in 2026. //This translates to $67 million in revenue in 2023 (using the average of years 2022 and 2023 assumptions) and $3.2 billion in 2026.
