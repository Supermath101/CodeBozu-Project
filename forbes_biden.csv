[+] direction for the government to provide a better level of service. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)//Customer service and the government … do they belong in the same sentence? Some may even say it’s an oxymoron. Our most recent customer service and CX research study included the following question://It didn’t surprise me that the majority of the 1,000 Americans surveyed said, “No.” After all, the government is known for difficult processes, slow response times and bureaucratic red tape that frustrate its “customers,” also known as citizens of the United States. The numbers came in with 62% negative responses, which means 38% felt that the government does deliver an acceptable level of service. //That said, we just completed an informal survey on LinkedIn asking the same question. Let me emphasize the word “informal,” as we just threw it out to the LinkedIn community. The results …//Ouch! Still, there may be some light at the end of the tunnel. //On December 13, 2021, just about three weeks ago, President Joe Biden signed an Executive Order that is a big step in the right direction for the government to provide a better level of service. This isn’t just lip service. The order contains very specific language about 17 federal agencies, with 36 “commitments” to improve the level of service. //According to the White House briefing, President Biden is “taking decisive action to promote fiscal stewardship by improving the government’s service delivery to its customers, the American people.” Just as the best companies and brands that are known for delivering excellent customer service, putting their customers at the center of everything they do, the Executive Order “directs Federal agencies to put people at the center of everything the government does.” //Some of the agencies the Executive Order impacts include the most customer/citizen-facing entities such as the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security, Passport services, the Department of Veterans Affairs, student aid and more. //The government issued a fact sheet that shares some of the most promising improvements. Here are a few examples://·        Internal Revenue Service: There are 240 million individuals and businesses who file tax returns, and 167 million call the IRS for help. According to the fact sheet, filers will now save time by having the option to schedule a customer support callback. This brings the IRS help line into the 2020s. //·        Traveling: Americans who travel will be able to renew their passports online, saving time and effort. Passengers will have shorter security and check-in lines due to improved technologies.//·        Retirement: The 54.1 million Americans over 64 (with approximately 4 million more each year) will be able to claim benefits online, check the status of their applications and more. Additionally, Medicare recipients will have online tools that save costs on drugs and streamline the enrollment process with the Social Security Administration.//·        Student Loans: Forty-five million Americans are managing student loans. The new system will be made easier by providing a “single repayment portal” on StudentAid.gov, eliminating the need to visit multiple websites to manage loans. //·        Updating Personal Information: More than 30 million people move each year. Rather than having to go to multiple government agency websites, they will now only have to visit one site that will share the information across multiple federal and state agencies. The same goes for the approximately 2 million people who change their names each year.//·        And much more!//The government is moving full speed ahead in adopting technology that will create an easier and more convenient experience for its citizens. However, it’s important to note that technology is not always the answer. Just as I preach to our clients who want to create the best experience possible for their customers, the same applies to the government: technology is great, until it isn’t. No matter how good you think the technology is (and it may be) if there is a glitch, a problem, a question or someone just wants a little help, there needs to be a human-to-human option that is easy to get to. //For example, the technology the IRS is using to allow callers to set an appointment for a callback is the perfect solution to long hold times. Consider that someone who is frustrated calls and is forced to wait on hold for an unreasonable amount of time. That creates even more frustration. The ability to set a time for a callback will help eliminate the frustration and time that would be wasted waiting for an IRS agent to pick up. The point is that technology and human-to-human interaction can work together to create a better experience. //Furthermore, once someone does reach a government employee, that employee must be properly trained. The effort that they are making in the technological world must be in tandem with an effort to give government employees the training they need to address customers/citizens in a way that is helpful and fosters a positive reputation. //It may take some time, but if President Biden is serious about a customer service initiative, we’ll see the results of the survey question start to reverse. (And if anyone from the government involved in this initiative wants to talk, just let me know. I’m ready to serve!)//", 9.6%

[+] of the Supreme Court of the United States and the Judicial Branch of government. (Photo by Robert Alexander/Getty Images)//1-8-22 — The story was updated with a statement from the National Safety Council.//There is a lot riding on the outcome of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision whether to allow the implementation of President Joe Biden’s vaccination mandates for employers with more than 100 workers. The Court heard two hours of oral arguments about the legality of the requirements on Friday. //The employer mandates would impact more than 80 million employees or about two-thirds of the U.S. workforce. If the Court allows the requirements to be implemented, the employers will need to://////National employment litigator David Gordon with Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp said that, “By January 10, large employers must have a plan in place to address the OSHA rule, and they must also have identified who is unvaccinated. //“It is unclear whether these obligations will be the subject of a brief stay. For now, employers must assume as if, on Monday, they will be subject to these requirements. Likewise, unless the court grants a brief stay while it decides the broader issues, all unvaccinated employees, as of Monday, must be masked while at work.”//There was no indication when the Court would issue a ruling.//Lorraine Martin, president and CEO of the National Safety Council, said in a statement that, “Covid-19 is the greatest workplace safety challenge in generations. The way we see it, employers shouldn’t wait on the courts to tell them what to do—they should implement these [mandates] because that’s the best way to keep workers safe and businesses operational.”//Opponents of the mandates told the Court they would cost businesses billions of dollars, impose administrative hardships on companies and organizations and force many people to quit their jobs.//CNN noted that, “Critics of the requirements, including a coalition of business groups and Republican-led states, say the Biden administration exceeded its authority in issuing such sweeping mandates....The administration, on the other hand focuses on the impact of the virus that has already killed some 800,000 Americans, closed businesses and kept children out of classrooms.”//U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices that Biden’s mandates would save 6,500 lives and prevent 250,000 hospitalizations in the next six months, and that exposure to Covid-19 is the biggest threat to workers in OHSA’s history.//According to Jeffrey Swartz, a constitutional law professor at Western Michigan University’s Cooley Law School, “The standard for maintaining or granting [a] stay is that there is no reasonable likelihood that the government will prevail on the issues at trial.  The government was able to provide evidence sufficient to show why they would succeed in court if the case went to trial, and their reasoning was enough to justify why the stay should be lifted.//“The issues here are far reaching relating to actions taken by administrative agencies. Most Americans have no idea how much we rely upon these agencies. They are able to promulgate rules in a much more rapid manner that the slow ponderous congressional ‘regular order’ and political disputes,” he said.//Nicholas Creel, an assistant professor of business law at Georgia College and State University observed that, “Chief Justice Roberts seemed very skeptical that the government was unable to enforce this rule, implying that the government could theoretically have been more aggressive in fighting the virus but choose not to. //“Further, Roberts was blatantly unswayed [by arguments] that the Post Office requesting a delay in the mandate’s implementation was evidence of it being problematic. Specifically, Roberts quipped that ‘’Just because the Post Office can’t do it efficiently doesn’t mean private industry can’t.’//“With Roberts often being a pivotal swing vote on this Court, this augurs well for those supporting the mandate,” Creel said.//He said that questions by Justices Breyer and Sotomayor implied “... that the Court understands that the alleged harms from the mandate going into force, such as mass resignations, are unlikely to materialize in the immediate term. This in turn makes it all the more likely that the mandate will be allowed to go into force this Monday as planned while the Court continues to debate the underlying issues.”//Creel said that one of the most notable statements in today’s arguments came from Justice Sotomayor, when she said that the OSHA rule was ‘not a vaccine mandate’ but was instead a mask and testing mandate for those who choose not to vaccinate.  //He observed that, “Justice Barrett was seemingly hinting at this logic as well when she asked the attorney challenging the rule if he thought OSHA could enforce a masking and/or testing mandate. It will be very unsurprising to see this distinction spotlighted in any opinion denying relief to those seeking to block the mandate. “//Creel pointed out that, “In seeking a stay to prevent the mandate from going into force, the attorneys challenging the rule claimed that between 1-3% of employees will quit their jobs if subjected to this mandate. //“The liberal Justices, Breyer especially, seemed to accept this result as likely but were nevertheless unpersuaded that the potential economic disruption caused by the mandate would outweigh the public’s interest in increasing vaccination rates.”// Gavin Villareal, a partner with law firm Baker Botts, said that, “While the argument was nominally about whether to grant an immediate stay, we saw the Justices struggling with who gets to decide if vaccinations should be required for American workers, the states or the federal government, and if the latter, whether Congress has specifically authorized the broad-reaching approach OSHA has taken its vaccination and testing in the Emergency Temporary Standard.//He said that, “In general, the conservative Justices seem to believe that OSHA exceeded its authority and the liberal Justices that OSHA had acted pursuant to adequate Congressional direction.”//Labor and employment attorney Matt Gomes said,” I think that all of the justices acknowledge that this is a difficult situation. They are all aware of the grave threat to public health. //“Even the conservative Justice Alito acknowledged that vaccination is the best way to combat the pandemic. However, they struggled with the question whether this Emergency Temporary Standard is the best way to accomplish the goal of incentivizing people to get vaccinated,” he said.//", 8.7%
"How A White House Tweet May Doom Biden’s Workplace Vaccine Mandate", "Biden Chief of Staff Ron Klain may have accidently put a dagger through the heart of Biden's vaccine ... [+] mandate for large employers. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)//Biden Chief of Staff Ron Klain may have accidently put a dagger through the heart of Biden's vaccine ... [+] mandate for large employers. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)//With the new COVID variant spreading across the nation at a lightning rate, President Biden is trying to implement an emergency order mandating that employers with more than 100 employees require either full vaccination or weekly COVID-19 tests and masking for unvaccinated employees. The rule is supposed to take effect this Monday and the Supreme Court heard an emergency motion yesterday to stop it from taking effect. (Biden is also ordering other vaccine mandates, but they are much less sweeping and won’t be discussed here.)//Congress has never passed a law mandating vaccinations and this sharply divided Congress isn’t about to pass one, so where does President Biden claim to get the power for this mandate? The Justice Department says that Congress has delegated broad powers to the Occupational Heath and Safety Agency (OSHA) to protect worker safety, including the power to require worker vaccinations. Under the law OSHA is charged with ensuring worker safety and health “by developing innovative methods, techniques, and approaches for dealing with occupational safety and health problems.” To that end, Congress authorized the Secretary of Labor “to set mandatory occupational safety and health standards applicable to businesses affecting interstate commerce.” //Presidents have no independent power to regulate workplaces, so President Biden is arguing that he is merely executing the power that Congress delegated to him through these broadly worded statutes. These are the sort of questions the Court deals with all the time. President Trump was particularly fond of governing through executive orders and was willing interpret various statutes as giving him extremely broad authority to do so. As a result, federal courts frequently struck down his executive orders.//One of the reasons Trump’s executive orders fared so poorly was that he had an itchy trigger finger when it came to Twitter. His tweets often undermined the arguments his own lawyers were making before the courts. For example, Trump kept tweeting about implementing a travel ban on Muslims even as his lawyers were arguing that his executive order was no such thing.//Therefore, one would think that the Biden Administration would know better than to tweet out messages that undercut their legal arguments supporting their actions. In this case, Biden is arguing that he is merely implementing the will of Congress as expressed in the statutes discussed earlier in this piece. //Unfortunately, the Biden Administration has failed to learn from Trump’s mistakes. Shortly after Biden gave a major speech announcing the vaccine mandate, his chief of staff, Ron Klain, re-tweeted a news anchor’s remark that: “OSHA doing this vaxx mandate as an emergency workplace safety rule is the ultimate work-around for the Federal govt to require vaccinations.”//That was a huge mistake. During oral argument Chief Justice John Roberts specifically referenced the tweet in a negative manner. He grilled the government’s lawyer, saying: “It seems to me that it's that the government is trying to work across the waterfront and it's just going agency by agency. I mean, this has been referred to, the approach, as a work-around, and I'm wondering what it is you're trying to work around.” //What Roberts is clearly implying is that Biden is trying work around the will of Congress rather than implement it. That is a dagger directly through the heart of Biden’s argument. Of the conservative Justices on the Court, he is generally considered the most moderate, and he arguably has special weight as the Chief Justice. If Klain’s gloating tweet has cost the Biden Administration Justice Robert’s trust, that was a very costly error.//Beyond the three liberal Justices on the Court, this leaves the mandate with few likely defenders. During oral argument, the Court’s newest Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, asked skeptical questions about why the mandate applied to low-risk outdoor professions like grounds-keeping as well as riskier indoor jobs. Justice Neil Gorsuch talked a lot about the “major questions doctrine”, which says that Courts should give less leeway to government agencies when their decisions are likely to have a widespread impact on the economy. //It is important to remember that this case is not about whether the vaccine mandate is a wise or foolish policy. The case turns on whether the Biden Administration is merely executing federal laws passed by Congress or unconstitutionally acting on its own. By calling its policy a “work around” the Biden Administration has cut its own feet out from under itself.//", 12.7%
"Biden’s Arms Sales Policy In 2021: A Year of Missed Opportunities", "Early in his tenure, President Biden signaled that his approach to selling arms around the world would mark a sharp departure from the policies of his predecessor Donald Trump. Unfortunately, the Biden administration has yet to follow through on the president’s promising early rhetoric.//Early in his tenure, President Biden signaled that his approach to selling arms around the world would mark a sharp departure from the policies of his predecessor Donald Trump. Unfortunately, the Biden administration has yet to follow through on the president’s promising early rhetoric.//When it came to arms sales policy, the first few months of the Biden and Trump administrations couldn’t have been more different. Trump chose Saudi Arabia as the destination for his first foreign trip, and upon landing there he promptly announced a $110 billion arms deal that would create “jobs, jobs, jobs” in the United States. The $110 billion figure proved to be a vast exaggeration, but Trump’s priorities were clear. Short-term economic gains would override concerns about strategy and human rights in the sale of U.S. weaponry. Trump persisted in this approach throughout his presidency, even after the Saudi regime’s murder of U.S.-resident journalist Jamal Khashoggi and its continuing, indiscriminate use of U.S. arms in its devastating war in Yemen.//Enter Joe Biden. In his first foreign policy speech, Biden pledged to end U.S. support for “offensive operations” in Yemen along with “relevant arms sales.” The State Department launched a review of U.S. arms sales to the Gulf States, including a $24 billion, three-part deal for F-35 combat aircraft, armed drones, and $10 billion worth of bombs for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Biden administration also suspended two offers of bombs to the Saudi regime that had been made late in Trump’s final term in office. The stage seemed to be set for a dramatically different approach to arms sales, one that recognized the value of restraint and elevated human rights concerns within the decision-making process.//OGDEN, UT - MARCH 15: A F-35 fighter jet take-offs for a training mission at Hill Air Force Base on ...

They currently have 17 that might be deployed in the fight against terrorism and ISIS in the near future. (Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)//Unfortunately, the Biden administration’s apparent commitment to arms sales restraint began to unravel within months of his initial foreign policy address. A dispute arose over what constituted arms being supplied to Saudi Arabia for “offensive” versus “defensive” purposes, and the administration rebuffed members of Congress who sought clarification on that crucial point. The Biden team signed off on the $24 billion arms package to the UAE despite that nation’s ongoing interference in Yemen, its violation of the United Nations arms embargo on the warring parties in Libya, and its internal human rights abuses. (The deal is now up in the air due to disagreements over U.S. restrictions on how the UAE may deploy and use U.S.-supplied F-35s, but the State Department has made clear that it wants the deal to go forward). Deals for air-to-air missiles and maintenance of attack helicopters for Saudi Arabia followed soon thereafter. The government of the Philippines – one of the most repressive regimes in the world – was offered a multi-billion-dollar deal for F-16 combat aircraft. And the administration relaxed Congressionally mandated human rights conditions on the repressive al-Sisi regime in Egypt.//There were reasons given for all of the above sales, from bolstering allies against Iran or China, to defending the Saudis from Houthi missile attacks, to maintaining relations with longstanding allies who might cooperate on counter-terror initiatives or other U.S. objectives. But none of these arguments justify arming human rights abusers and enabling reckless military establishments like those in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, or the Philippines.  //In Yemen, for example, over a quarter of a million people have died since the commencement of the Saudi/UAE-led coalition’s intervention there in 2015, and millions more are at risk of starvation due to a Saudi-imposed blockade on air flights and fuel imports. The U.S. role in enabling this mass slaughter is not only a moral stain on the reputation of the United States, it is a destabilizing force that undermines any hope of fostering peace and stability in the Gulf region and the broader Middle East. The appropriate policy should be to cut off essential U.S. maintenance and spare parts – without which the Saudi military could not function – as leverage to end the blockade and push the Saudi regime to negotiate in good faith towards an inclusive peace agreement to end the war. Anything less represents a moral and strategic failure of the highest order.//There is still time for the Biden administration to change course. It is about to announce its Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) policy, which is supposed to serve as basic guidance for the administration’s arms sales decision making going forward. If the policy emphasizes human rights over narrow economic and short-term strategic considerations it could set the stage for an approach more in line with President Biden’s initial rhetoric on arms sales. Of course, that will only be the case if the CAT policy is truly utilized as a guide to decisions on what arms to sell and to whom. //President Trump’s CAT policy heavily emphasized the purported economic and industrial benefits of arms sales, with human rights as an afterthought. Trump’s actual approach largely followed this blueprint. //On the other hand, President Obama’s CAT directive made ample references to human rights and restraint, but that did not prevent the administration from offering tens of billions of dollars in weaponry to Saudi Arabia, much of which was put to use in the Yemen war. //In short, a policy statement alone, no matter how forceful, is no guarantee of a better approach to arms sales. But it is an opportunity to change course, and the sooner the Biden administration does so, the better.//", 9.3%

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)//After his election in November 2020, Joe Biden said he would be “a president who seeks not to divide, but unify’’ the country. As I noted at the time, the task of unifying the country would be easier said than done. That turned out to be an understatement of historic proportions.//Since Biden’s election, the political crisis he faces has steadily worsened, morphing from challenges in unifying the country into an existential crisis about the future of American democracy. //In a speech to the nation Thursday marking the first anniversary of the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, President Biden described the crisis that is now facing the nation in stark and memorable terms.//Speaking from Statuary Hall in the Capitol, Biden said, “At this moment we must decide what kind of nation we are going to be. Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm? Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people? Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies? We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation.//"For the first time in our history, a President had not just lost an election. He tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob reached the Capitol," Biden said. "But they failed. They failed. And on this day of remembrance, we must make sure that such an attack never, never happens again."//Biden said, “Make no mistake about it: We’re living at an inflection point in history. Both at home and abroad, we’re engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy, between the aspirations of the many and the greed of the few, between the people’s right of self-determination and self—the self-seeking autocrat.//"I believe the power of the presidency and purpose is to unite this nation, not divide it. To lift us up, not tear us apart," he concluded. //Reuters reported that Biden “accused his predecessor Donald Trump of posing a continuing threat to American democracy and warned that Trump's false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud could unravel the rule of law and undermine future elections.//"We must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie. Here's the truth: A former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He's done so because he values power over principle," Biden said.//Biden added that "for the first time in our history a president had not just lost the election he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power." //Immediately after Biden’s remarks, the AP reported that Trump responded with a statement of his own, saying that the president “used my name today to try to further divide America.”//Jeffrey Swartz, a constitutional law professor at Western Michigan University Cooley Law School, said ‘’The speech was necessary to set the tone for what may be coming [and] trying to avoid claims of political retribution.//‘’This was not a unification speech. It was a warning. It served to show that Biden can be a president of purpose and forcefulness.”//Communication consultant Spencer Critchley is the managing partner of the Boots Road Group. He observed that, “President Biden needed to speak forcefully, and he did. Too often, we forget that there's a difference between a leader and a manager.//“Leadership is more mystical than many modern-day rationalists are comfortable recognizing: a matter of strength of character, not just technocratic skills; communicated through actions and symbols, not just facts and logic,” he said.//“So, more important than anything Biden said was the way he said it. It's the same with democracy. It can't just be a machine for delivering services. It turns out there needs to be a ghost in the machine after all: the ‘soul’ Biden talks about, as old-fashioned as that may sound to modern, cynical ears. Democracy requires us to be rational, but we can’t only be rational. Ultimately, democracy is a civil religion, as Robert Bellah argued,” Critchley commented.//Nicholas Creel is an assistant professor of business law at Georgia College and State University and a political scientist. He said that, “After reviewing Biden’s speech today, it seems as clear as ever that no words can likely bridge the political gap in today’s America. Only time will heal these wounds of ours and when our political figures being discussing events like January 6 each side will only further retreat to their already hardened positions, continuing to view the opposition as an enemy. //“This illustrates that there are some things we must all accept as being outside our ability to repair, or else we risk doing more damage with our actions despite our best intentions. Inaction can at times be the best action to choose,” Creel concluded.//Stacy Rosenberg is an associate teaching professor at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College. She said, “Business leaders can extract from this political crisis that once stakeholders have made a decision, changing minds proves difficult. This is why focusing on brand loyalty is so critical. //“The success of the Republican party in maintaining devoted members despite countless crises, like the violent attack on the Capitol, can be attributed to building an ideological tribe through communication tactics. Businesses similarly need to build their tribe, yet must do so with integrity,” she advised.//Debra Caruso Marrone is the owner of PR firm DJC Communications. She thought that, “President Biden's speech today stood out and may be remembered as historic. Rather than pulling punches, the president was direct, unwavering and strong. //“Business leaders can learn from the speech that being direct, strong and unwavering -with the facts on one's side— signals leadership. Leaders should not shrink from making their opinions known when they're straightforward and honest. It pays to go out on a limb and take a stand when there's a lot at stake,” Marrone said.//", 10.0%

[+] September 28, 2021, in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)//In 2021, Joe Biden disappointed Americans who expected him to reverse Donald Trump’s protectionist trade policies. Will 2022 bring better policies? To find out, I asked three leading trade experts. //“I expect a modest—very modest—liberalization of the steel and aluminum tariffs, via managed trade [TRQ or tariff-rate quota] agreements with other U.S. allies like Japan,” said Scott Lincicome, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Cato Institute. “These will probably look a lot like the U.S.-E.U. (European Union) deal, meaning some tariff liberalization for a select amount of imports but below historical levels and nothing anywhere close to free trade. I expect all of the China tariffs to remain, and it’s a coin flip as to whether Biden will extend the solar safeguard tariffs in early 2022. If I had to wager on the latter, I’d put my money on an extension. Other than that, I expect more of Biden’s protectionist 2021 on things like Buy America, the Jones Act and other trade-related industrial policy (e.g., in the Build Back Better bill).”//What about U.S. policy changes toward multilateral agreements? “I don’t ‘expect’ it but wouldn’t be shocked to see the Biden administration re-engage on CPTPP [Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership] after the November mid-terms,” said Lincicome. “Otherwise, maybe a little something at the WTO [World Trade Organization] but nothing groundbreaking.” //Other trade experts are only somewhat more optimistic. Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, does not expect the Biden administration to take many steps to remove protectionist trade policies. “They may substitute a more reasonable or useful set of targets for China trade than the so-called ‘Phase One’ agreement,” he said. “They may find other places to substitute quotas for tariffs as they did on steel and aluminum with the European Union. All that says they want managed trade, and will not rollback protection, even if they slightly improve its form.”//On the international front, Posen sees some possibilities for liberalization. “There are a few places where I think the Biden administration may encourage trade liberalization indirectly by pursuing other policies,” he said. “The implementation of the international corporate minimum tax should remove some major distortions to trade and some legitimate claims of injustice. Positive steps on decarbonization would remove a justification for future trade barriers. //“National security goals may push the Biden administration to encourage expansion of CPTPP (excepting China) and of E.U. relations East and South. The economy running hot with rising interest rates will diminish incentives for aggressive currency manipulation by others against the dollar. This might also lay the groundwork for a future U.S. administration to face less hostility to trade liberalization.”//“It would be a pleasant surprise if the Biden administration began to remove protectionist policies instituted during the Trump administration,” said Bryan Riley, director of the National Taxpayers Union’s Free Trade Initiative. “Last year, President Biden maintained the Trump administration’s ineffective tariffs on imports from China, modified instead of eliminating restrictions on steel and aluminum imported from allies, and watched from the sidelines as other countries lined up to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That's a slow start, to say the least.”//Riley does not expect major movement on trade from the Biden administration in 2022. “The Biden administration is likely to keep trade policy on the back burner. If inflation fears mount, perhaps that will lead to some modest liberalization, but I wouldn't bet on it. Congress may take action on the Generalized System of Preferences, which lowers tariffs on some imports from low-income countries, and the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill, which cuts tariffs on some imports used by U.S. manufacturers,” he said. “But it may also approve new subsidies for favored industries and embrace a government-led industrial policy.”//Riley thinks there is a chance that if Republicans take control of Congress “perhaps legislators will push back against Biden's tariffs in a way they were unwilling to do during the Trump administration.” Still, looking ahead, the future of free trade in the Republican party remains uncertain. “The big question is whether the next Republican presidential candidate will be President Trump or someone similar, or someone who better understands the importance of trade for America's future,” said Riley.//As 2022 began, the U.S. government remained mostly absent from important international trade developments. “China joins U.S. allies including Japan and Australia in a new Asia-Pacific trade agreement that launches Saturday—with the U.S. watching from the sidelines,” reported the Wall Street Journal, “The new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, will eventually eliminate more than 90% of tariffs on commerce among its 15 member countries, in what economists say will be a boon to trade in the region.”//To most trade experts, it appears that while other countries are busy playing chess, U.S. leaders are playing checkers—and may even respond to world events by placing more tariffs on chess sets.//", 12.4%
"Joe Biden’s Year In Federal Regulation, 2021", "Today is New Year’s Eve. Yesterday, December 31, 2021 was the last federal workday of the year.//Today is New Year’s Eve. Yesterday, December 31, 2021 was the last federal workday of the year.//TOPSHOT - US President Joe Biden sits in the Oval Office as he signs a series of orders at the White ... [+] House in Washington, DC, after being sworn in at the US Capitol on January 20, 2021. - US President Joe Biden signed a raft of executive orders to launch his administration, including a decision to rejoin the Paris climate accord. The orders were aimed at reversing decisions by his predecessor, reversing the process of leaving the World Health Organization, ending the ban on entries from mostly Muslim-majority countries, bolstering environmental protections and strengthening the fight against Covid-19. (Photo by Jim WATSON / AFP) (Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)//This presents an obvious opportunity to survey the Federal Register for the first time under Joe Biden. //The Federal Register is the daily depository of rules and regulations produced by hundreds of federal departments and agencies. //While the first few weeks of 2021 still belonged to Trump, the drawing to a close of Biden’s first calendar year in the White House lets us take a broad look at the current occupant’s regulatory output and how it stacks up to predecessors.  //As the saying goes, Donald Trump’s regulatory reform and deregulatory agenda wasn’t something Biden tossed aside lightly; he hurled it away with great force, systematically revoking it in word and deed. //For reference, at year-end 2020, Donald Trump’s overarching “one-in, two-out” directive Executive Order 13,771 was being met in technical terms, even upon the emergence of pandemic with its torrent of spending, emergency actions and regulation. That doesn’t mean Trump’s program lacked an endless supply of critics and accusations of failure (see my deep analysis of this automatized deep state feature here). There was never a chance for a reform minded executive surrounded by a comfortable bureaucracy uninterested in having its boat rocked to actually shrink the government without Congress engaged and backing up the changes legislatively. This also applies to any future aspirant. Plus, Trump had big-government urges of his own, analyzed elsewhere.  //Biden has no regulatory reform project to monitor the success of, so we can’t do that. He rejects, like those individuals and institutions that surround him, the notion of regulatory streamlining altogether, the Trump amalgam of which he called “harmful policies and directives." It’s only Biden’s first year, but observers will be monitoring additions, not subtractions. //Under Biden, the regulatory establishment has its Hall Pass back, and it shows. //The Federal Register page count ended the year with 74,532 pages. Here’s the December 30, 2021 cover.//National Archives, Federal Register, December 30, 2021//The count’s unadjusted; the National Archives will eventually subtract a small percentage of skips and blanks and post a final tally.//The 2020 count under Trump was far higher, at 86,356. There had been “only” 61,308 pages back in Trump’s first year of 2017, which had been the lowest count in a quarter-century (since Bill Clinton’s 61,166 pages in 1993), as can be seen in the table below. //While former President Obama set the all-time record with 95,894 Federal Register pages in 2016, Trump’s first year represented a 35 percent drop from that height. But Trump’s final year made him number two, well above Obama’s non-record years and way beyond the Clinton and Bush eras. //How come? Well, broadly, government does far more things now. But down in the trenches, as part of the bureaucracy’s preservation arsenal, removing rules that ought not have been written in the first place still requires writing new rules to do it. That’s part of the workings of the 1946 Administrative Procedure Act’s public notice-and-comment mechanism. So, paradoxically, any concerted Trump moves on “one-in, two-out” in service of deregulating and removing that which came decades before required fattening the Register to some extent. The same will apply for any future adventurer. //Things are more complicated than that, of course; see the Trump “bookend” edition of Ten Thousand Commandments for some of the details, including how many rules and guidance documents were issued under both Trump and Biden relating to the Covid-19 response that would not otherwise have been part of the picture. For example, in both of the past two years the Small Business Administration issued dozens of significant rules pertaining to the Paycheck Protection Program created under the coronavirus CARES Act.//Despite Biden’s lower Federal Register page count, we’re nonetheless back in the mode of not just unapologetically but combatively fattening the Federal Register, at the behest of a president who calls himself a “capitalist” but who believes he and other progressive experts know best in their pursuit of a slate of new domestic forever wars that involve both heavy government spending and regulation.//For reference and perspective, here’s the breakdown since the first President Bush of both page counts and the number of rules (to be covered next) in the Federal Register since 1989.//Federal Register pages and number of rules from Bush One to Trump. Compiled by the author from ... [+] National Archives, Federal Register//As for the number of final rules and regulations contained among all those tens of thousands of pages, there had been a notable net reduction under Trump, despite the Register’s growth. Two years ago, the Federal Register closed out with 2,964 final rules within its pages, which was the lowest count since records started being kept in the mid-1970s. (That there are few records from before is interesting in and of itself.) //As the chart above also shows, back in the 1990s it was “normal” to see over 4,000 rules issued each year. Counts were even higher in the 1970s and 1980s. Even Obama’s record high count of 3,853 didn’t match those heights. //Biden’s rule count at the end of 2021 stands at 3,257.  This is the second-lowest rule gross count since records have been kept. It’s comparable to the 2020 count under Trump of 3,353, and basically in line with Trump’s other years apart from the 2019 dip. //A difference, though, is that several hundred of Trumps rules had been deemed “deregulatory” for purposes of his one-in, two-out program, making the “net” for each year lower. It was a notable achievement at the time that all four of the lowest-ever annual rule counts belonged to Trump, even without taking the deregulatory among them into account. //Biden’s revivalist counts are embedded with no such purpose, and the apparent Biden paradox here starts to fade further when when looks a little more deeply at the subset of costlier rules. //Despite the relatively “low” gross rule count for 2021, it became apparent months back that larger rules were mounting a comeback under Biden, and were returning to Bush/Obama heights. The chart below updates that observation for year end. Of Biden’s 3,257 rules completed, 387 were deemed “significant” (the yellow bar segments at bottom) by agencies and the Office of Management and Budget. The money is on the se and overall rule counts increasing during Biden’s term as well. //Granted, this is less than Trump’s final year, which contained deregulatory measures not netted out. That final year also incorporated a supply of the much-analyzed midnight rules that tend to accompany the closing of any presidential term, whether or not the chief is re-elected. But Biden is off to a significant-rule start that’s far larger than Trump’s earlier years, which are the lowest counts of the entire period depicted in the chart (or earlier, for that matter). It is predictive of future significant rule counts that regulatory activism is back, and that significant rule counts are back to Bush/Obama levels already. //Federal Rues, including significant rules, issed 2008 thru 2021//Like page counts that will be adjusted slightly in a National Archives reckoning, Biden’s 2021 final tally could change a bit. (Over the years, one periodically finds counts of earlier years’ rules changed or inexplicably reclassified in the Federal Register database. For example, a few of the historical rule and significant rule counts as presented a year ago and serving as basis for this recent chart have changed markedly compared to what I’ve presented just above; they could change again, and reasons merit exploration by future reformers.) //The administrative state is alive and well, but Trump definitely left a mark. Biden is working on erasing it. It’s not depicted here, but significant proposed rules appear to be mounting as well, so the entire enterprise bears watching. Earlier this month, I provided some analysis of agencies regulatory agendas and plans under Biden. //There exist well-known problems with using the Federal Register and even rule counts as a measure of the extent of regulation. But there has been so much opportunity over decades to remedy this lack of transparency that it is apparent that cloudiness is a feature rather than a bug of the administrative state. It is good for those who write regulations that they cannot be measured well and that accountability only occasionally enters the room. //Steps to improve disclosure and measurement are worth pursuing in the New Year as attention shifts to the makeup of 2023’s 118th Congress. Needed are executive and congressional actions on regulatory streamlining, particularly with respect to agency guidance documents and mandatory disclosure of regulatory burdens, including the neglected ones imposed by independent agencies. Options for reform range from an “Office of No” charted to counter regulatory orthodoxy, to a regulatory budget, to forcing Congress to approve any significant or controversial rule before it can be effective. //None of these things will of interest to the Biden administration in 2022, unless substantial pressure is brought to bear, particularly with respect to the propensity to exploit economic and health crisis to expand federal power.//Happy Regulated New Year!//", 6.9%

"Biden Hasn’t Cancelled Student Loans, But That Doesn’t Make Him The Bad Guy", "President Joe Biden (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)//President Joe Biden (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)//President Joe Biden hasn’t cancelled all student loans, but that doesn’t make him the bad guy.//Here’s what you need to know — and what it means for your student loans.//There seems to be a major disconnect in the narrative about student loans and student loan cancellation. Student loan advocates, including members of Congress, have blamed Biden for any lack of wide-scale student loan cancellation. Some have claimed the president broke a key campaign promise to cancel student loans. Others have claimed Biden has executive authority under the Higher Education Act of 1965 to cancel all student loans for every student loan borrower, but has failed to use it. Critics have blamed the president for any and all lack of action on student loan cancellation. (How to qualify for automatic student loan forgiveness). As student loan borrowers suffer financially, others say the president isn’t acting to cancel student loans and alleviate their challenges. Let’s examine.//Biden has cancelled more student loans than any other president. That shouldn’t be glossed over in any way. Since becoming president last January, Biden has cancelled $12.7 billion of student loans. Regardless of your politics or views on student loan forgiveness, the Biden administration objectively has been pro-student loan borrower and cancelled student loans at a record pace. This includes billions of dollars in student loan cancellation for student loan borrowers with a total and permanent disability, student loan borrowers seeking public service loan forgiveness, and student loan borrowers who were misled by their college or university. Biden also made major changes to student loan forgiveness that will help more borrowers get access to student loan forgiveness. (Biden won’t cancel student loans before student loan relief ends).//Congress, not the president, has the power to make laws. This includes laws on student loans or on student loan cancellation. Some members of Congress have shifted the focus to the president, and they have suggested that only Biden has the power to cancel student loans — and for some reason hasn’t. This rhetoric hasn’t come from Republicans, but from progressive Democrats who view Biden as too moderate. The truth is that Congress is the appropriate branch of the federal government to pass any potential legislation on wide-scale student loan cancellation. (Biden extended student loan relief, but advocates really want student loan cancellation). Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have proposed up to $50,000 of student loan cancellation for borrowers. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has proposed total student loan cancellation of all private and federal debt. (More student loan relief could look like this). Currently, there aren’t enough votes in Congress to pass any student loan cancellation. Why? It’s not a popular policy position. That’s hard for many student loan borrowers to digest, but beyond progressive Democrats, there is little appetite to pass wide-scale student loan cancellation. Rather than finger-point, Congress should work on an alternative plan to address the cost of higher education that can gain bipartisan support. (Biden said he will cancel student loans for millions of borrowers, but Congress hasn’t passed any legislation).//Certain members of Congress regularly refer to Biden’s supposed executive authority to cancel student loans. They cite the Higher Education Act of 1964 and claim that all Biden needs is a pen to sign an executive order to wipe out billions in student loan debt. This suggests that everyone is waiting on the president to act, but he simply has refused. That’s not exactly accurate, however. While members of Congress are entitled to their opinions, this is not a mainstream legal opinion. The mainstream legal opinion, which the president and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) have both referenced and is consistent with constitutional law, is that the president doesn’t have unilateral executive authority to cancel all student loans for all student loan borrowers. It’s up to Congress to pass legisation on student loan cancellation, and Biden repeatedly has asked Congress to cancel up to $10,000 of student loans for borrowers. Only a court will determine whether the president has such unilateral authority. Until then, any indication that the president has or doesn’t have such authority is an opinion and not a final determination. (6 things to do right now for your student loans).//It’s important to note that the president represents all Americans, including student loan borrowers, former student loan borrowers, and those who never had student loans. Student loan borrowers represents about 20% of adult Americans, which means 80% either paid off their student loans or never had student loans. Student loan cancellation is a popular topic among student loan borrowers, but it’s not as popular among those who don’t hold student loans or never went to college. The president supports wide-scale student loan cancellation of $10,000, but he may not enact wide-scale student loan cancellation. (What Biden’s last student loan relief means for your student loans). This doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to help student loan borrowers or hasn’t made progress in reducing student loan debt. When considering the best policies for the country, Biden must weigh several factors, including how it will impact the American people. This may be frustrating to student loan borrowers, but Biden’s economic policies must be viewed against a wider backdrop.//The cost of higher education is a real problem. College is prohibitively expensive, and members of both parties agree. The question is what can Congress do to alleviate the financial burden of students and parents so they can attend college, achieve the American Dream, and not be burdened financially with a lifetime of student loan debt. A world without debt would mean financial independence for millions of Americans who could buy a home, get married and start a family, and save for retirement. What can colleges and universities do to make the cost of college more affordable for all? Student loan cancellation is one approach, and Biden has actively pursued it loan relief along with three extensions of student loan relief. However, the president isn’t the “bad guy” because there hasn’t been wide-scale student loan cancellation for every student loan borrower.//Student loan relief won’t last forever.

"Why President Biden Will End Up Giving Putin What He Wants In Ukraine", "The Biden administration is working hard to build a coalition of European partners capable of deterring Russia from invading Ukraine.//The Biden administration is working hard to build a coalition of European partners capable of deterring Russia from invading Ukraine.//Allied capitals are saying all the right things, but if you listen closely it is not hard to detect an air of desperation hanging over the effort.//Washington knows none of the Europeans are willing to fight for Ukraine’s sovereignty, and the Europeans know Washington won’t either.//Russian leader Vladimir Putin doesn’t want to actually occupy Ukraine—which he could easily do east of the Dnieper River that bisects the country—but he does want to neutralize it as a military threat.//Ukraine's geographical circumstances make it difficult to defend, a problem that will grow as ... [+] Belarus is reabsorbed into Russia. //That means keeping Ukraine out of NATO, precluding use of its territory for Western military bases, and minimizing any military cooperation between Kyiv and western capitals.//Biden’s team, led by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, tells a brave story about why any such guarantees are off the table, but in the end the administration will give Putin most of what he wants.//Biden & Co. just won’t admit publicly that is what’s happening.//In order to understand why Putin’s campaign of intimidation is likely to bear fruit, you need to consider some salient facts about the Ukraine situation that seldom get mentioned in mainstream media accounts.//Nobody in NATO wants Ukraine to join. Although strengthening ties with the West is the centerpiece of President Volodymyr Zelensky’s foreign policy, his corrupt and backward country would bring nothing of value to the Atlantic Alliance. Its military is dreadfully underfunded—Kyiv spent less than a billion dollars on weapons last year—and its geopolitical circumstances render it nearly indefensible.//As NATO expanded after the Soviet collapse, the handful of Western members who provide 90% of its funding acquired mutual defense commitments to a dozen Eastern European countries lacking the wherewithal to defend themselves. In the process, it also absorbed a raft of political frictions among new members that make the overall alliance less cohesive. The last thing London and Paris and Washington want today is to add another weak “partner” to their overstretched alliance.//The U.S. electorate is sick of being called on to save the world. Washington has fallen into a multigenerational pattern of sending troops to prop up tottering regimes far from home. Vietnam. Lebanon. Somalia. Afghanistan. Iraq. The countries invariably are led by corrupt elites, and the U.S. typically fails to achieve its objectives. Any U.S. military involvement in Ukraine would repeat this pattern and discredit the administration in the eyes of voters.//President Trump repeatedly called out America’s European allies for failing to share the burden of common defense, and probably would have pulled America out of NATO had he served a second term. President Biden has worked to rebuild ties with Europe, but his base is likely even more opposed to foreign military involvement than the GOP’s base is. So, it is hard to see where there is a domestic constituency to do anything militarily in support of Ukrainian sovereignty, such as sending more weapons or building bases there.//Ethnic Russians comprise 17% of Ukraine's population and are concentrated in the red areas on the ... [+] map. The current crisis is not about reuniting two predominately Russian countries.//Russia remains a nuclear superpower. The most important military fact about Russia gets the least mention in coverage of the Ukraine crisis. Moscow possesses thousands of nuclear warheads, including at least 1,550 capable of reaching America and many hundreds more available for use in Europe. It thus is well within the capacity of Russia to obliterate every major city in the West within a few hours.//Popular culture has become so accustomed to the existence of these weapons of mass destruction that it is simply assumed they will never be used. However, that is not what Russian military doctrine says, and the most plausible scenarios whereby a conventional conflict might escalate to nuclear use all involve Eastern Europe. Participating in an expanded NATO has already extended U.S. nuclear commitments to incredible lengths, so getting crosswise with Russia over Ukraine is a dangerous idea. People do crazy things in crises.//Ukraine is too close to the Russian heartland. If Vladimir Putin was a committed democrat, his fears about Western military threats might be unfounded. But he isn’t. Putin the autocrat views his country’s geopolitical needs as demanding a buffer with the West, which is one reason he is moving to reabsorb the beleaguered country of Belarus into Mother Russia. Thus, the idea of NATO forces in Ukraine evokes a response not unlike the U.S. response when Russia sought to place missiles in Cuba.//This is not just paranoia. Kyiv is only 469 miles from Moscow, well within the combat radius of F-35 fighters that cannot be tracked by Russian radar. When those fighters begin hosting NATO’s tactical nuclear weapons later in this decade, they will be a powerful deterrent to regional aggression. But they will also increase Moscow’s fears of a decapitating preemptive strike in a crisis, so of course Putin wants to keep their bases as far away as possible.//Putin will desist if he can claim victory. Some old hands in the diplomatic and intelligence communities are warning that neutralizing Ukraine is just the first step in Vladimir Putin’s grand design to recreate the Soviet Union. Maybe so, but President Biden’s team is more concerned at the moment with forestalling an imminent invasion than with what the distant future looks like. If Putin can fashion the Western response to his demands as a victory, that will likely be enough to keep him happy (for now).//After all, actually invading and occupying a country the size of Ukraine could be costly in both money and lives—and that’s before we even get to the sanctions that inevitably would follow. Thus, Biden & Co. can probably finesse the situation by tacitly agreeing to Putin’s demands without being explicit. No NATO membership, no bases, minimal military aid. Putin can put whatever spin he wants on that outcome, while the administration contends that no formal commitments have been made. The crisis would thus be resolved and Biden could return to the domestic concerns that will likely determine the fate of his administration.//", 7.7%
"Student Loans: Biden Wants Student Loan Borrowers To Do 3 Things", "President Joe Biden (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)//President Joe Biden (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)//President Joe Biden wants student loan borrowers to do 3 things during student loan relief.//Here’s what you need to know — and what it means for your student loans.//Your federal student loan payments may be paused temporarily through May 1, 2022, but that doesn’t mean you should sit back and relax. Since March 2020, more than 40 million student loan borrowers have enjoyed the following student loan benefits://////Biden extended student loan relief for 90 days in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and persistence of the Omicron variant. (What Biden’s latest student loan relief means for your student loans). In announcing the fifth extension of student loan relief from the Cares Act, however, Biden encouraged student loan borrowers to do 3 things with their student loans to prepare for the restart of student loan payments. (How student loan payments will be easier in 2022).//The U.S. Department of Education has multiple resources that can help you prepare for the restart of student loan payments. (Here’s how to get student loan forgiveness during the Biden administration). For example, you can learn about income-driven repayment plans, forbearance, deferment and other ways to pay off student loans. You can start on the Education Department website to learn more about student loan forgiveness, student loan consolidation, student loan servicers and student loan default. You can also login to your student loan account through Federal Student Aid (FSA) to check your student loan balance and manage your student loans.//Income-driven repayment plans are a good option for federal student loan borrowers who are struggling financially to pay student loans. There are four main income-driven repayment plans: Income-Based Repayment (IBR), Pay As You Earn (PAYE), Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR). Income-driven repayment plans set your monthly federal student loan payment based on your discretionary income, family size and state of residence. It’s possible to get a monthly student loan payment as low as $0. (More student loan relief may be coming). To learn more, contact your student loan servicer. With an income-driven repayment plan, it’s also possible to get student loan forgiveness after 20 years (for undergraduate student loans) or 25 years (for graduate student loans) of monthly student loan payments. If you’re already enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan, make sure to update your income, family size and state of residence at least annually so that your student loan payments reflect your unique financial situation.//You may not work in public service, but you want to if you want to pay off student loans faster. Congress created the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program in 2007 to help federal student loan borrowers get student loan forgiveness. (Biden won’t cancel student loans before student loan relief ends).To qualify, you’ll need to satisfy several requirements, including, among others, working for a qualified public service or non-profit employer, making 120 monthly student loan payments, enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan. While the public service loan forgiveness program has at one time rejected 99% of applicants, the Biden administration made major changes to the program to help more student loan borrowers get student loan forgiveness. Until October 31, 2022, student loan borrowers can submit a limited waiver to “count” past student loan payments that previously didn’t qualify. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is still available, so if this of interest to you, you could consider a career working for a qualfiied public service or non-profit employer. Contact your student loan servicer for more details. (How to qualify for automatic student loan forgiveness).//Student loan forgiveness advocates may support these 3 things, but they are more focused on Biden enacting wide-scale student loan forgiveness. In Biden’s announcement of the extension of temporary student loan relief, Biden made no reference to student loan cancellation.

"Supreme Court Justices Signal They May Block Biden’s Vaccine Mandate For Private Employers — But Not For Healthcare Workers", "The Supreme Court heard arguments Friday over the federal government’s workplace vaccine requirements, with key conservative justices signaling they may be willing to temporarily block President Joe Biden’s vaccine-or-test mandate for large private employers—but could be more open to a separate mandate for healthcare workers.//The Supreme Court heard arguments Friday over the federal government’s workplace vaccine requirements, with key conservative justices signaling they may be willing to temporarily block President Joe Biden’s vaccine-or-test mandate for large private employers—but could be more open to a separate mandate for healthcare workers.//The U.S. Supreme Court building on January 6 in Washington, DC. //The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in challenges to two federal mandates: one requiring all private employers with more than 100 employees to mandate vaccines or regular Covid-19 testing, and another requiring vaccines for healthcare workers at facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid.//During the private employer hearing, Chief Justice John Roberts questioned the Biden Administration's strategy of using different agencies — like the Department of Labor and Health and Human Services — to implement vaccine mandates as a "work-around" to issuing a federal vaccine mandate without congressional approval.//Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett appeared to express some sympathy with the challengers — business groups and GOP-led states — with Barrett asking a lawyer if they believed the mandate was too overbroad in its scope and Kavanaugh suggesting he could side with the view that the issue should be left up to Congress, not the executive branch.//Barrett also questioned whether the federal government was justified in imposing the vaccine-or-test mandate as an emergency rule, rather than a regular rule that would require a public comment period and greater scrutiny before it could be implemented.//Key justices appeared potentially more sympathetic to the healthcare mandate, however, with Kavanaugh noting that Republican state officials were challenging the requirement, but the medical facilities actually affected by the mandate “in fact overwhelmingly appear to support” the rule.//Barrett said she disagreed that statutes for certain medical facilities the Biden administration used to justify the policy actually support their case, however, suggesting she may favor limiting the mandate to apply only to some healthcare facilities and not others—a position the Biden administration said would be acceptable, as more than 90% of healthcare workers work in facilities they believe would pass Barrett’s scrutiny.//Roberts also suggested he may believe the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) can legally issue its vaccine-or-test mandate, asking an attorney arguing against it, “Why wouldn’t OSHA have the authority” to issue the most effective measure possible against Covid-19 by requiring vaccines or tests. //The healthcare worker and private employer mandates are two of four such requirements the Biden administration has imposed, along with mandating vaccines for federal contractors and employees. The policies have garnered heavy controversy even as polls show most Americans approve of them. The large employer mandate was reinstated by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on December 17 after the 5th Circuit blocked it in November, prompting more than 10 challenges to be filed at the Supreme Court. Biden’s healthcare worker mandate, which applies to those working at facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid, is now blocked in a combined 24 states. The Supreme Court has previously upheld a number of smaller vaccine mandates, including state-level requirements for healthcare workers in New York and Maine.//Whether the private employer policy will start being enforced before the court rules, though the challengers have asked for a decision before then. The vaccine-or-test mandate for large employers already took effect Tuesday, but the Department of Labor said it will not start penalizing employers who don’t comply with the policy until January 10, or before February 9 for the testing requirements. The healthcare worker rule was due to go into effect January 4, but federal health officials said in late December it will not start enforcing the policy until January 27 for the first phase (in which workers must have received at least a first dose of the vaccine) and February 28 for the second.//Two of the attorneys arguing against the mandates, Ohio Solicitor General Benjamin Flowers and Louisiana Solicitor General Liz Murrill, participated in the hearing Friday remotely because they tested positive for Covid-19, Reuters reports. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is at higher risk for severe complications for Covid-19, also participated remotely. All Supreme Court justices are fully vaccinated and boosted, and the court requires attorneys arguing before the court to test negative for the virus.//Biden’s federal contractor mandate has also wound up in court, and was temporarily blocked in federal district court in early December. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals declined to reinstate the mandate, but the case has not yet made it to the Supreme Court.//Supreme Court Now Weighing Multiple Lawsuits Against Biden’s Vaccine Mandate (Forbes)//Here’s Who’s Most—And Least—Likely To Support Vaccine Mandates In The Workplace (Forbes)//Appeals Court Lets Biden’s Healthcare Worker Vaccine Mandate Take Effect In 26 States (Forbes)//Appeals Court Restores Biden’s Vaccine-Or-Test Mandate For Large Employers (Forbes)//Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus//", 10.0%
"Biden Blames Trump For January 6 Insurrection In Anniversary Address: ‘Values Power Over Principle’", "President Joe Biden vehemently hit back against the 2020 election lies pushed by former President Donald Trump that fueled the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol building, blaming the ex-president for the violence and decrying how the rioters “held a dagger at the throat of America” in an address Thursday that marked the one-year anniversary of the insurrection.//President Joe Biden vehemently hit back against the 2020 election lies pushed by former President Donald Trump that fueled the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol building, blaming the ex-president for the violence and decrying how the rioters “held a dagger at the throat of America” in an address Thursday that marked the one-year anniversary of the insurrection.//President Joe Biden speaks from Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol to mark the one year anniversary ... [+] of the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol by supporters loyal to then-President Donald Trump on Jan. 6 in Washington.//Biden recalled what Americans saw on January 6, including “rioters rampaging,” waving Confederate flags and assaulting police officers—but noted how Trump sat in the White House “watching it all on television and doing nothing, for hours.”//Trump “created and spread a web of lies” about the election because he “values power over principle,” has a “bruised ego” and “can’t accept he lost,” Biden said.//The president hit back against Trump’s rhetoric that claimed Election Day was the “true insurrection” and the rioters were the “true patriots,” saying the mob that stormed the Capitol was acting “not in service of America, but rather in service of one man.”//American history is at an “inflection point,” Biden said, calling on Americans to “step up” and be “firm, resolute and unyielding in our defense” of the right to vote and for Congress to pass voting rights legislation.//Biden emphasized there is “zero proof” the 2020 presidential results were tainted by fraud, saying efforts by Republicans to undermine the vote count and pass laws that make it harder to vote are “un-American” and show they realize the “only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert the election.”//Trump sowed doubt about the election results even before Election Day because he was “looking for an excuse, a pretext to cover the truth,” Biden said, describing Trump as “not just a former president,” but a “defeated former president.”//“Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm? Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people? Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth, but in the shadow of lies?” Biden said. “We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation.”//Vice President Kamala Harris also said in separate remarks Thursday that January 6 reflected both the “fragility of democracy” and its “strength.” Harris asked whether January 6 will be remembered as a “moment that accelerated the unraveling of the oldest, greatest democracy in the world” or one “where we decided to strengthen our democracy for years to come,” saying Americans “cannot sit on the sidelines” and “must unite in defense of our democracy.”//In a statement responding to Biden’s speech, Trump continued to make false claims about election fraud and criticized Biden’s comments as “political theater,” saying the president invoked him “to try to further divide America.”//Polls show a majority of Americans agree with Biden’s blaming of Trump for the events of January 6, with recent polls by the Washington Post/University of Maryland, Morning Consult and ABC News/Ipsos all finding approximately 60% of respondents believe the ex-president bears at least some responsibility for the attack.//Congressional Democrats are still trying to pass voting rights legislation as Biden has pushed for, which has so far been unable to pass the Senate due to opposition from Republicans and moderate Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.). Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) threatened Monday the chamber will vote on whether to abolish the filibuster by mid-January if Republicans oppose voting rights. That would allow a bill to pass with only a simple majority rather than have to garner Republican support, but would also require support from Manchin, who is so far still skeptical about backing the proposal, and fellow moderate Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.).//The year since the January 6 attack has been heavily marked by Trump’s ongoing false claims about election fraud, which have sparked widespread distrust in the U.S. electoral system among Republicans. There is no evidence of widespread election fraud in the 2020 presidential election, as numerous official audits and analyses have concluded, and Trump and his allies lost more than 60 legal cases alleging issues with the vote count in the aftermath of the election. Nevertheless, the false election claims have continued to fuel Trump’s allies in the GOP, who have launched partisan election audits and passed 34 state laws in 2021 that make it harder to vote in the name of “election integrity.”//Americans Still Blame Trump For The Insurrection — And Think Democracy Is Under Threat, Polls Find (Forbes)//Schumer Threatens Vote On Filibuster Changes Over Blocked Voting Rights Reform (Forbes)//", 5.6%
"Biden Administration Doubles Orders For Pfizer’s Anti-Covid Pill As Hospitals Run Short", "The federal government doubled its order of Pfizer’s Covid-19 antiviral pill Paxlovid to 20 million treatment courses, the company announced Tuesday, after hospitals ran low on the drug that was hailed as a game-changer when authorized in December.//The federal government doubled its order of Pfizer’s Covid-19 antiviral pill Paxlovid to 20 million treatment courses, the company announced Tuesday, after hospitals ran low on the drug that was hailed as a game-changer when authorized in December.//Pfizer headquarters in New York City.//The 20 million Paxlovid courses, or 600 million total pills, will be delivered to the federal government in 2022, with about 10 million courses due for an accelerated delivery by the end of June and the rest set to arrive by late September, Pfizer announced.//Though White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci described the authorization of oral Covid-19 treatments like Paxlovid and Merck’s molnupiravir as a “very important step” in ending the pandemic, hospitals and pharmacies in Michigan, New York, Ohio and Rhode Island are reportedly running low on the drugs.//Covid-19 antiviral pills have been distributed according to a population-based formula, though Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) complained Sunday that New York, which is undergoing an infection surge not accounted for by the formula, had not received sufficient doses.//Most of the antiviral pills distributed to Maryland have not yet arrived due to shipping delays, state health officials told the Washington Post Monday.//The active ingredient in Paxlovid requires six to eight months to produce, and the sharp disparity between supply and demand has made the treatment “a drop in the bucket in the short term,” University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher David Boulware told The Hill last month.//At-home treatments are in steep demand as the highly transmissible omicron variant of the coronavirus has grown to account for 95.4% of U.S. cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Paxlovid received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration on December 22 for use by high-risk patients ages 12 and older who weigh at least 88 pounds. Each treatment course requires the patient to take 30 pills over five days. Clinical trials show the drug to be about 89% effective at preventing hospitalization or death among high-risk patients. Pfizer’s Paxlovid has proven more effective than Merck’s molnupiravir in clinical trials, though the federal government has also ordered about 3.1 million doses of molnupiravir.//Vaccines remain the most effective way to prevent severe infection or death for most people, Houston Medical Director of Pharmacy Services Alex Varkey told the Washington Post. “We shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that covid vaccines are readily accessible and available,” Varkey said.//Paxlovid may be rendered ineffective if taken with the herbal treatment St. John’s Wort, Pfizer warned.//“Biden administration to double purchase of Pfizer's COVID antiviral pill to 20M treatment courses” (Fox News)//“Doctors bemoan limited supply of game-changing antiviral pills amid winter surge” (Washington Post)//“U.S. Has Secured ‘Millions’ Of Pfizer Antiviral Pills, President Biden Says” (Forbes)//", 4.7%

[+] Court Auditorium of the White House in Washington, DC on December 23, 2021. (Photo by Nicholas Kamm / AFP) (Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images)//One of the most underappreciated policy changes in higher education the past five years was the gigantic giveaway from the Trump administration to for-profit colleges. //The scope of the largess was and has been appalling, as Trump and his appointees rolled back important safeguards for students, reversed policies requiring for-profit schools to prove they provided value and overtly interceded to rescue, resuscitate and rehabilitate predatory schools. The direct cost to taxpayers was in the billions, funds that went nearly directly to Wall Street investors. The indirect cost to students and the quality of our education system remains uncounted. //The impact of the damage caused by for-profit colleges – the often online, often predatory and loan inducing colleges that can afford to spend millions on advertising – is well documented. //And so, when Biden defeated Trump in 2020, higher education leaders expected his team to reverse the Trump reverses – redeploying some of the protections and quality measures that Obama had successfully and prudently implemented. //Most of us are still waiting. //Granted, we’re less than a year into Biden’s term and he has had other fish to fry, as the saying goes. But, so far, the needed recalibration we all expected has yet to materialize. Worse, what has materialized has been disappointing. //That is not to say Biden and his team have done nothing on for-profit colleges. In March and again in June, his administration did forgive the loans of students who attended some for-profit colleges. But these are loans that were already issued – the investors who ran the schools in question already got the money. //In truth, those loans should probably never have been issued. And Biden has done little, if anything at all, to stem the ongoing river of taxpayer dollars flowing to for-profit schools in the form of grants and subsidized student loans. That lack of action will only pile on the cases of loan forgiveness and add to student debt. In other words, forgiving the loans helped some past victims of for-profits but did nothing to limit it, now or in the future. //In October, Biden’s Federal Trade Commission did send stern warning letters to 70 of the big for-profit colleges such as DeVry University, Grand Canyon University, University of Phoenix and Walden University. The letters advised the schools they could be subject to fines and other penalties if they used false or deceptive ads regarding job prospects or employment demand. //That’s good too, but, yet again, it’s a warning. It’s not an actual change, not altering the landscape that for-profit colleges have learned to game or the environment that allows them to continue to scoop up tax-payer funded profit. //In another example, the ‘gainful employment rule’ – an Obama rule that made for-profit colleges prove their graduates could actually find jobs that justified attending their schools and enriching their investors – was rolled back under Trump. Also in October, Biden’s lawyers essentially said that Trump’s repeal of the rule, a massive boost for for-profit colleges, was fine.  //In an understatement, that’s not what many of us expected from Biden. //It’s disappointing because there are so many things Biden could do in this area – to limit the ongoing damage done by investor-run schools. //He could, for example, ask his agencies to regulate the troubling, cynical and deceptive practice of for-profit colleges trying to convert to and hide as non-profits. It’s a practice the Government Accountability Office describes as “insider benefit” deals and it says the 17 schools it tagged as potentially doing it received a staggering $1.8 billion in federal funds. //To help address the same problem, Biden could also ask the IRS to stop blindly approving applications from schools to become ‘non-profit.’ It’s confusing and litigious. The IRS can’t possibly tackle what is or is not a non-profit school, nor should they. //On the same problem, he can and should also have his Department of Education sit down with accrediting bodies – though officially independent, they get their power from the Department – and ask them to scrutinize and review these “insider benefit” deals and the colleges that are essentially run by for-profit companies while selling themselves as non-profits. Such colleges are generally referred to as captured non-profits. //And Biden should absolutely and immediately remove the accrediting authority of ACICS – the entity that “accredits” many of the country’s for-profits. Obama revoked their authority, citing a tragic history of complete largess. Trump reinstated it. Under Biden, ACICS is still operating. //Trying to be understanding of the other legitimate crises that Biden and his team are trying to address, keeping the pressure on these for-profits, the outlaws of legitimate education, may not feel like the top priority. And, in fairness, it’s probably not. But it is important. And most of what Biden could do, he can do without the aid or consent of Congress. //And so, while many of us wait, we wonder – are meaningful actions coming and just delayed? Or did we fool ourselves into thinking Biden would be at least as good as Obama at protecting students and ensuring the quality of colleges and the degrees they award?//", 7.5%
