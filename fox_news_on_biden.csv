Scott Applewhite)"In fact, President Biden’s own CDC director said the vaccine does not prevent transmission," Scalise said. "This is the same administration that allowed union bosses to write their own school reopening guidelines and has created mass confusion with their mixed public health messaging.""If Democrats on the Committee were truly concerned about misinformation, they would hold an open hearing with Biden administration officials where they can answer questions in full and transparent view of the American people, rather than hiding the facts after failing to ‘shut down the virus,‘ as President Biden promised," the Republican whip continued. "They have no one to blame but themselves for their many failures and self-created crises that are hurting hardworking families across America."Comer demolished Biden over his failed promise "to ‘shut down the virus,’" noting that all the president has "shut down is Americans’ confidence in his ability to lead us out of the pandemic."Rep.

"The American people deserve transparency and accountability, but all they’ve gotten from the Biden administration and congressional Democrats are broken promises."Clyburn and Maloney gave a joint statement to Fox News in a Tuesday email blasting the Monday letter as "disingenuous" and attacking Republicans as attempting to shift the blame of a loss of vaccine confidence away from them."Yesterday’s Republican letter is yet another disingenuous attempt to deflect blame away from Republican irresponsibility that is resulting in the loss of American lives," the Democrat leaders said. "Republicans and their right-wing disinformation machine are undermining vaccine confidence and then blaming the sitting president for a crisis of the unvaccinated that Republicans created."President Joe Biden is greeted by Rep.

"While we would welcome Republicans’ bipartisan participation in this oversight, we unequivocally reject Republican talking points equating the Biden administration’s science-based response to emerging variants with President Trump’s reckless, politically driven non-response that cost American lives."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe war of the words between the party leaders comes after Scalise and Comer sent a letter to the pair of Democrat leaders calling for a joint hearing into President Biden’s "failed" COVID-19 pandemic response.The lawmakers called for a joint hearing regarding the Biden administration’s oversight of the pandemic and demanded a plethora of witnesses appear, including Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, White House COVID response director Jeffrey Zientz, and White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci.The panel discussed how the Biden administration's focus is on voting rights despite the many crises plaguing the White House.President Biden said he was "insulted" by a reporter's question Tuesday wondering if he felt that way about Stacey Abrams skipping his speech on voting rights on her Georgia turf."Any thoughts on Stacey Abrams skipping your speech today, sir? Are you insulted she's skipping your speech?" a reporter asked at the White House ahead of Biden traveling to Atlanta."I'm insulted you asked the question," Biden said before smiling. "I spoke to Stacey this morning. We have a great relationship. We got our scheduling mixed up. I talked to her at length this morning.

Some other progressive Georgia voting rights groups are also skipping the speech in protest, with one former NAACP president telling the New York Times that Democrats need more action and less talk.Stacey Abrams, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate, leaves after meeting U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, during a stop at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., March 19, 2021.(REUTERS/Carlos Barria)"We don’t need any more photo ops.

Bob Menendez, D-NJ, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer urge the administration to redesignate El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and make a new designation for Guatemala.2021 IN REVIEW: HOW THE PUSH FOR AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS STUMBLED"It is our assessment that the severe damage caused by back-to-back hurricanes just over one year ago, combined with extreme drought conditions, and the social and economic crises exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, warrant such an action by the administration," they wrote.TPS protects nationals of designated countries living in the U.S. from potential deportation if they are eligible and also allows them to apply for work permits, as well as giving them the freedom to travel. El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua have TPS designations but the registration periods have ended.The Democrats claim that the designation and redesignations would "provide critical protections for eligible beneficiaries and enable them to support basic needs of loved ones back home and invest in safer alternatives to irregular migration." They also say it could be consistent with the administration’s pledge to address "climate migration."Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 4, 2022. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)((AP Photo/Susan Walsh))The letter cites a number of justifications for the move, including increases in food insecurity, violence and "rising social tensions" as a result of natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic.The lawmakers claim that such designations would give the U.S. more time to partner with governments to make sure that their return "does not create further instability and volatility."MANCHIN DEALS MAJOR BLOW TO DEMOCRATIC EFFORTS TO INCLUDE AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN SPENDING BILL Reuters cited estimates that expanding the designation could cover more than 2 million Central Americans, but those estimates were made before the enormous border crisis that erupted last year -- meaning that the number could be even higher now.Separately, Democrats have also been pushing to grant a pathway to citizenship for TPS holders in both a broad immigration reform package and as part of the budget reconciliation bill. Sen. Menendez has been a key lawmaker in both those efforts.Those efforts were torpedoed in 2021, with the immigration package failing to pick up Republican support, and the budget reconciliation package -- which would have passed without Republican support -- losing the backing of Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. Lawmakers and advocates have pledged to continue the push for immigration protections in 2022.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Biden administration designated Haiti for TPS last year for 18 months amid ongoing security concerns, poverty and human rights abuses in the country.

The committee was convened with a focus on the riots that took place at the Capitol last year."I've decided to establish a Domestic Terror Unit to augment our existing approach – this group of dedicated attorneys will focus on the domestic terrorism threat, helping to ensure that these cases are properly handled and effectively coordinated across DOJ and across the country," Olsen announced.SEPTEMBER 11 COMPARISONS ABOUND ON ANNIVERSARY OF CAPITOL RIOT: 'LIKE RETURNING TO THE PENTAGON AFTER 9/11'The Justice Department building in Washington.(Reuters)"While there is no single federal crime that is labeled ‘domestic terrorism,’ the criminal code does define domestic terrorism, and this definition provides us with expanded authority, included advanced sentences for terrorism offenses," Olsen continued.The FBI National Security Branch's executive assistant director, Jill Sanborn, also spoke at the hearing. Several Republican members of the committee pushed back on the DOJ's emphasis on the Jan. 6 riot, instead focusing on other areas of concern for national security.Sen. Mike Lee of Utah grilled the Justice Department representatives for details and concrete data on a variety of topics related to the Jan. 6 investigations – a series of questions that touched on charges filed, trial outcomes and the demographics of those arrested."Has anyone been charged with the crime of insurrection following Jan. 6?" Lee asked the DOJ representatives, both of whom said they could not answer but were unaware of such charges being filed against anyone involved in the riot.Lee attributed his intense series of questioning to the DOJ's allegedly sluggish and unhelpful response to the senator's previous inquiries outside the legislature.BIDEN IN JAN. 6 SPEECH SHARPLY CRITICIZES TRUMP AS SPREADING ‘WEB OF LIES,' STOKING RIOTSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham asked Olsen and Sanborn a series of questions about the resources and finances available to the DOJ."Do you need more money, and changes in the law to do your job?," Graham asked, to which Olsen replied that he did not.Graham continued, asking Olsen if the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan had invigorated terrorists in the region."From my vantage point, international terrorism remains a priority, and if I may broaden my answer a bit to say that we continue to be very concerned about ISIS forces in Afghanistan," Olsen replied. "We continue to have concerns about ISIS.""How many people have come across our southern border from special interest countries?" Graham followed up.Both Olsen and Sanborn said that they did not have that information available to them.Pro-Trump supporters climb the west wall of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington.(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)"It's been three to four thousand.

"Here's some advice – if you need more resources, you'll get them from me, but if I were you, I'd go to the border and check out what's going on, because it's just a matter of time, in my humble opinion, that the broken southern border is gonna be an entryway for international terrorists who are going to come here and kill a lot of Americans if we don't change the policy."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTrump supporter Ashli Babbitt was shot and killed by Capitol Police inside the building on the day of the riot, while two others in the melee died of natural causes and one of a reported overdose.

"There have been reports of the Taliban harassing some NGOs and it’s possible they could levy taxes or fees on aid workers."The aide added: "No taxpayer money should be going to the Taliban and the Administration needs to make sure it can monitor this assistance ... The Taliban should have no role in determining who receives it."The Biden administration said Tuesday the aid will provide care for the most vulnerable, including women, girls, minority populations and people with disabilities.

Texas, since the 1980s, has had days – has early voting days – and both states have increased them in their latest election laws. Georgia went up to 18, Texas went up to 14. Delaware, for the first time in its history, will allow early voting this coming fall for eight days. So, the president better get there and make a compelling case that there is something specific and fundamentally flawed in the way that Georgia administers its elections that requires this federal statute.

The study, for the first time since it was launched in 2008, states that the likelihood of a "mass-casualty terrorist attack on the United States or a treaty ally by a foreign terrorist organization" is low, and no longer judged to be a priority, but some of the experts disagreed with that assessment.The worldwide "terrorism risk hasn’t necessarily fallen," Harvard Kennedy School professor Meghan L.
