"5 Reasons Why It Makes Sense To Claim Social Security As Early As Possible (Age 62)", ".//.//Social Security has always been a uniquely American Rorschach Test. Should you take what’s offered to you right now or wait a few years for what’s behind the curtain?//Fortunately, you don’t have to have visions of Monty Hall haunting your Social Security claiming decision. There’s actually a fairly reliable checklist you can go through to determine if it makes sense for you to start collecting your government pension as early as possible (i.e., age 62).//Here are five reasons why it makes sense to do so://Face it, if you’re up against the wall and are plum out of options to collect money that will put food on the table, then you need to start receiving your Social Security funds as soon as you’re eligible.//Sallie Mullins Thompson, Principal/Managing Member, Sallie Mullins Thompson CPA PLLC in New York City, says you should pull the trigger on Social Security “if you’re not working and have no plans to seek a job, you have little to no savings/investments/retirement funds, and you have no other sources of income, such as from a trust fund or inheritance. This would generally be for a fairly dire financial situation.”//Of course, the situation need not be as dire as this, but you still might be experiencing a gap between what you have and what you need.//“If you don’t have enough assets to cover the difference between what’s provided by your retirement savings, streams of income or other sources of assets in retirement and your retirement spending requirements,” says Glenn Moore, CIO/CCO at Gordon Asset Management, LLC in Durham, North Carolina, “then it would make sense for you to take Social Security so you are not putting unnecessary stress on your retirement assets or your standard of living while deferring Social Security.”//Beyond the raw mathematics of not having enough income, there are other legitimate reasons to begin receiving Social Security early. These reasons tend to be very case specific and often come with nuances that go well outside what a simple written checklist can adequately cover. It therefore makes sense to speak to an expert who knows your specific circumstances to determine if these reasons apply to you.//The expert who immediately comes to mind is your doctor. After income need, the status of your health comes most into play regarding your Social Security claiming decision.//“Health is always a consideration,” says Chuck Czajka, Founder of Macro Money Concepts in Stuart, Florida. “If you don’t think you’re going to live until the normal mortality rate, then it might make sense for you to begin taking Social Security before the age of 70. It wouldn’t make sense to wait until age 70 to get the most you can collect only to pass away shortly after.”//There are actually two factors at play here. First, addressing your health issues can cost money, money you don’t have. Second, there’s actually a “break-even” analysis that goes into determining if you should wait to claim Social Security. It’s a guessing game but it’s based on your life expectancy. In short, you need to live long enough for it to make sense (as in “dollars and cents”) for you to defer.//“If you’re in bad health, you may need the extra money that Social Security benefits provide—and you may want to claim benefits sooner rather than later,” says Lyle Solomon, Principal Attorney at Oak View Law Group in Rocklin, California. “And, unfortunately, if you believe you will not live to be extremely old, you may come out ahead over your lifetime.”//Things tend to get complicated if you’re married. If both spouses can claim Social Security, the timing of those individual claims (as well as the age of each spouse) will have a bearing on the decision of when to start taking Social Security.//“If you have the lower Social Security benefit in a couple, and especially if you are much younger than your spouse, then waiting until the maximum age probably won’t have much benefit for you,” says Jeremy Keil, a retirement-focused financial planner with Keil Financial Partners in New Berlin, Wisconsin.//Because of the variety of scenarios, here again it’s best to speak with a professional who has had experience in advising couples on Social Security claiming strategies.//“In some cases, one spouse is waiting to claim spousal benefits, which requires the higher benefit spouse to also claim so the other can piggy back on the other spouse’s benefit,” says John Hagensen, Founder and Managing Director at Keystone Wealth Partners in Chandler, Arizona. “Waiting on one in this situation can effectively make you wait on both if the spouse with the smaller benefit has little or no benefit on their own earnings record.”//Somewhat related to the above is the complex concept of survivor benefits. The numbers and the variety of variables involved here can be burdensome, even if you have one of those “Social Security Calculators” at your fingertips. Here’s one example.//“If you’re retired at age 62, your spouse is younger than you, and your spouse earns less than you, your Social Security benefit could very well one day become theirs,” says Cory Bittner, Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer at Falcon Wealth Advisors in Mission Woods, Missouri. “If you believe it’s likely they will outlive you, it may make sense to delay collecting your benefit, so the survivor benefit increases in value. However, if your younger spouse has health issues and it’s not a sure thing that they will live to be older than you, it may make sense to go ahead and begin collecting those benefits. If your spouse earns less than you, it’s possible their benefit may not get to its maximum potential until the spousal payment portion begins—which requires you to file for your own benefits. The spousal benefit does not increase upon full retirement age, so if your spouse is older than you, waiting to collect your Social Security could impact how many years your spouse is able to collect spousal benefits. And if your spousal benefit is less than half of yours, it may make sense to open your work record to pay a spousal benefit. Also, if your spouse earns more than you but your spouse is in poor health, it may make sense to begin collecting early. If your spouse passes away before you, your benefits will end when your spouse passes, and you will begin collecting your spouse’s benefits. But you’re not going to collect both. Delaying your own benefits and then delaying your spouse’s benefits so you can receive a higher survivor benefit may be outweighed by going ahead and beginning collecting.”//There’s an elephant in the room no one wants to talk about but must be considered. For years now the Trustees who oversee the Social Security program have been warning it will become insolvent sometime in the early 2030s. This will have a necessary impact on the government’s ability to make good on its promise.//What that means is pure speculation at this point, but there are those who foresee a reduction in benefits. If this happens, future payouts will be less than currently expected. This scenario, in effect, devalues deferring Social Security.//“Older people, particularly those nearing retirement age, are concerned about the future of Social Security; yet, they are unlikely to be affected much,” says Solomon. “Still, if the prospect of losing Social Security payments keeps you awake at night, it may be preferable to file early or at full retirement age rather than wait for a higher sum.”//The Social Security claiming decision is not one to be taken lightly. Even if you are certain of what you want to do, it’s best to review all the alternatives with your advisors because it’s nearly impossible to reverse the decision you ultimately make.//“Once you begin collecting Social Security, you are locked into your payment amount for the rest of your life (with the exception of annual cost-of-living adjustments), so this decision is very important,” says Susan Dover, Founder of Social Security Resource Center in Philadelphia. “A good question to ask yourself is whether you can afford to live on the reduced Social Security benefits for the rest of your life.”//One way to analyze the different scenarios is by exploring the reasons why it makes sense to wait until age 70 before taking Social Security.//", 15.9%
"Spanish Family Winery Survival Saves Century-Old Ungrafted Bush Vines", "Image of Almansa castle in Castilla la Mancha, Spain//Image of Almansa castle in Castilla la Mancha, Spain//A secret garden of vineyards sit at 2,300 feet and beyond in elevation within a tiny wine region called Almansa in Spain, surrounded by limestone mountains called El Mugrón that protect the old, dry-farmed bush vines that are ungrafted as it is a place that is quite isolated from anything from the outside world. Ungrafted vines are always a remarkable sight in Europe considering that European vineyards were almost wiped out completely by an American pest called phylloxera, hence why many European grape vines are grafted onto American rootstocks to combat it. Almansa soils are mainly made up of limestone and they are poor in nutrients and the combination of having such a soil with an arid, cooler climate makes it difficult to grow anything besides cereals, olive and almond trees and vineyards that produce low yields.//Close up of old bush vine//It is a town that, many times, gets passed up as one drives from Valencia on the central eastern coast to the city of Madrid without the person knowing that in their rearview mirror is a special designated wine region that specializes in such unique dominant red grape varieties such as Garnacha Tintorera (known as Alicante Bouschet in France) and Monastrell (known as Mourvèdre in France). But if European wine history has taught the wine world anything it is that many wine regions were never fully discovered because there wasn’t a strong enough transportation infrastructure to assist them with getting their wines to markets in major cities and the wine regions that became popular early on were able to construct vital infrastructures to vital markets. //It is amazing that these old bush vine vineyards were able to survive in a tiny delimited wine region in Spain that had no fast track to fame, especially considering that the European Union was paying vineyard owners to pull up their vines as there was a European wine surplus - combined with these low yielding vines make it difficult to make a living when they are tragically being blended away into bulk wine; even the Spanish Civil War, from the mid to late 1930s, played a part as many of the wine producers from the small town of Almansa either died in the war or were part of the hundreds of thousands of people who just went missing during and after that time. Yet one family was able to continue on and kept these old bush vines alive: Bodegas Piqueras. //Bodegas Piqueras//Luis Piqueras started making ‘jug wine’ for his neighbors in 1915 and he was one of the few locals that had the great fortune of coming into a significant amount of money in the late 1920s and hence he was able to buy a large plot of land where he would build a modern winery over time. Luis’s son-in-law Mario Bonete went on to study winemaking and today, Mario’s son, Luis’s grandson, Juan Pablo Bonete Piqueras runs the winery with his brother continuing to strive to showcase these vineyards so they will survive for generations to come. As Juan Pablo (known as JP1) was standing in his tasting room surrounded by black and white photos of his grandfather and father, he stated that his father, Mario, established the Almansa DO in the 1960s to make sure it was recognized as a quality winegrowing area. “In fact my father was the president of the DO for more than 18 years and I was also the president of the DO for eight years,” Juan Pablo said with pride as it is very much a family mission to keep the Almansa wine region alive with his brother, nephews and soon to be his son joining the fight. And considering there are only 12 wineries that are a part of the DO and 750 grape growers with Piqueras producing over 80% of the wines from the Almansa DO, if Piqueras decided to close shop it would have a massive negative effect on the region.//Luis Piqueras//The winemaker of Bodegas Piqueras, Juan P. Cantos, affectionately called JP2, is another one who has joined the fight after spending many years learning from other wineries around Spain, as well as a harvest to refine his white winemaking skills in New Zealand, and he even won a competition to become a winemaking student at the legendary Spanish winery Vega Sicilia. Interestingly enough he was born in Almansa but his winemaking dreams took him to other places until four years ago when he decided to come back home mainly due to family and friends but he discovered in the process of coming back that there was a wealth of old bush Monastrell and Garnacha Tintorera vines.//Bodegas Piqueras with surrounding vineyards during the winter//Juan Cantos is very well aware that the red variety Monastrell is not only better known coming from the Southern Rhône (Mourvèdre) but also from other areas of Spain such as Jumilla and Yecla – the latter being a wine region he has already previously worked in, and that Garnacha Tintorera a.k.a. Alicante Bouschet is a rare red variety from Southern France with red flesh as well as dark skins yet has recently made a strong name for itself in Southern Portugal, its often proclaimed adopted home. But Juan Cantos makes a case for those who love these grapes, and those who are curious about them, that the Almansa wine region is a place that shouldn’t be missed but getting that message out is difficult because their budget as a wine region is severely limited due to only having a handful of wine producers in the region.//Wealth of Old Vines in a Modest Wine Region //View Of stars against the sky at night with a tree slightly lit up in Almansa, Spain//Bodegas Piqueras makes a few different lines of wine and the ‘Castillo de Almansa’ is the most widely distributed; one can find them in the U.S. from $12-$15 and although they are their middle tier wines, they still contain 45 to 65 year old dry-farmed Monastrell and Garnacha Tintorera with the ‘Selección’ containing Monastrell, Garnacha Tintorera and Tempranillo from 65 to 90 year old dry-farmed, ungrafted bush vines. Then their premium line of wines go by Piqueras such as their ‘Piqueras VS’ that contains 50% Monastrell and 50% Garnacha Tintorera from dry-farmed, ungrafted bush vines that are over a century old, and the VS is such a beloved wine that it is the only one that Juan Cantos and Juan Pablo Bonete Piqueras sign. Juan Cantos has been working on a couple of fun projects such as the ‘Piqueras Wild Fermented Verdejo’ white wine and the newly released ‘Los Losares’ which are two different single varietal wines from a single vineyard that is 3,000 feet in elevation containing a stony soil with vines that are over 80 years old; there are two bottlings, only 6,000 bottles made of each, one is from the old dry-farmed, ungrafted bush vines of Monastrell and the other with Garnacha Tintorera. //It is still a struggle to get the word out about these special vines that are off the beaten path, tucked away in this limestone mountainous area of Almansa but at least there is a producer such as Bodegas Piqueras who has been able to guarantee a paycheck for these farmers year in and year out for over a century; if it wasn’t for Piqueras, potentially all of these old, ungrafted vines and a way of life that involves traditional vineyard farming techniques would be lost as other places around the world are certainly much more famous and can command higher prices, unlike the unknown Almansa. And to think, it all came down to one day, the day that the founder Luis Piqueras bought a lottery ticket for eight pesetas and he ended up winning the equivalent of $50,000. That not only changed everything for the home winemaker to invest in building a professional winery but it changed the courses of actions that could have taken place for the entire winemaking area as the farming families would have to grub up these precious vines just so they could put food on the table. And it is only fitting that a woman who runs their administration office in logistics is the granddaughter of the man who sold Luis that ticket. A moment in time that altered the future lives of so many yet this community is still hoping to get to the next level... where the globe recognizes the value they bring to the wine world.//", 8.3%

"Ron DeSantis Just Trashed More Jeb Bush Policies. Is That Good News For Education In Florida?", "MELBOURNE, FLORIDA, UNITED STATES - 2021/03/22: Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis speaks at a press ... [+] conference at the Eau Gallie High School aviation hangar. (Photo by Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)//MELBOURNE, FLORIDA, UNITED STATES - 2021/03/22: Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis speaks at a press ... [+] conference at the Eau Gallie High School aviation hangar. (Photo by Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)//Yesterday, Florida’s governor called on legislators to drop the Florida State Assessment, Florida’s big end-of-year high stakes test. Here’s how Florida’s Department of Education announced it.//On September 14, 2021, Governor DeSantis announced that the state will file Legislation to eliminate the common-core based, end-of-year Florida Statewide Assessment and create the new Florida Assessment of Student Thinking (F.A.S.T.). By creating the F.A.S.T. plan, Florida is becoming the first state in the nation to fully implement progress monitoring instead of end-of-year standardized testing, and will fully eliminate Common Core.//Is this a big deal? More importantly, is it an improvement? //Does this really kill Common Core?//As soon as he took office, DeSantis announced he would rout out “all vestiges of Common Core.” That almost certainly wasn’t going to happen; removing the standards is like removing on the painted lines from a heavily rutted road, with many other factors keeping people right where they were. Teaching materials, programs, and tests were still aligned to the core.//It’s true, however, that the high-stakes Big Standardized Test was the biggest animator of zombie core standards. Removing it could help kill the core. Of course, many states have removed the Common Core standards with other standards that are remarkably similar to the core. //What about the high stakes?//Removing the high stakes from a testing program would be a huge help to getting education back on track. But education commissioner Richard Corcoran has stated that all of the high stakes— school grades, third grade retention, turnaround plans, teacher evaluations based on testing—will stay in place. The DOE website insists that the new system “protects Florida’s #1 in the nation school accountability” (there is no national measure of school accountability, though if there were, it would be surprising to find Florida at the top of the list). //So all the stakes will be in place—just attached to something else. That would be F.A.S.T.//Is F.A.S.T. an improvement?//The new system is based on progress monitoring, which means essentially that instead of taking a single huge high stakes test at the end of the year, students will take smaller high-stakes assessments all year. Lots of assessment means students have a better chance to prove themselves, but it certainly doesn’t change the notion that school will be organized around high stakes testing. //Will local districts be able to design their own tests, or, as is more likely, will the year-long series of tests be contracted out to a test manufacturing company? And what rules will be connected to the mountains of data that this year-long testing regimen will generate? Who gets to keep it, use it, and sell it? //Some longtime Florida observers see this as a step toward implementing Competency Based Education, which would open even more worm-filled cans.//So, should folks be happy about this?//Many Florida teachers are, and that’s understandable, because F.A.S.T. provides a chance to assess the students in real time over the course of a year instead slamming them with a single-test snapshot in the spring. //Longtime critics of the Common Core test-and-punish legacy of Jeb Bush are enjoying the current administration’s continued rebuke of Bush policies. Florida’s political leaders have always been fervent members of the Cult of Testing; this is the state that once forced a terminally ill child to pretend to take the test, and held back third graders who passed their classes but didn’t take the Big Standardized Test (arguing in court that “report cards are meaningless”). So to see the current group calling the tests “archaic” and saying “I want more learning and less test prep” is a welcome change, and a serious continued reversal of Bush policies (not to mention of their own policies from not so long ago). There’s nothing quite like hearing your point adopted by people who have been telling you for years that you’re wrong.//Are there political angles here? Sure. DeSantis appeared to be aiming for some national juice with aggressive anti-vax and anti-mask policies, but that strategy isn’t looking very great right now. High stakes testing is loathed by parents and teachers of all political persuasions. //Waiting and seeing//At this point, DeSantis has merely expressed his intent, and it means nothing until the legislators turn it into law. Details will matter tremendously, and we have yet to see any. Will this kill high-stakes testing, or merely transform it into another equally-malignant form? Will this be a shot in the arm for public education, or for profiteers looking to make an education-flavored buck? Will the new version of high-stakes judging of schools and teachers and students be more fair, or more disastrous? Stay tuned.//", 8.8%

"The rules that govern fair play are voted on, agreed to and expected to be upheld by all NCAA member schools."//Alex Spiro, Bush’s attorney, slammed the NCAA’s decision on Wednesday, calling it a “draconian penalty of a teenage kid who had his award taken based upon a sham investigation.” He added in a statement: “You have to wonder if profiting from kids for this long has clouded the NCAA’s judgment as to why we have student athletics in the first place.” //Both USC and Bush suffered severe penalties as a result of Bush accepting gifts. Most notably, the USC football program was forced to vacate all 12 of its wins during the 2005 season and Bush's stats during the season are no longer officially recognized. Bush and USC were also ordered in 2010 to disassociate from themselves for 10 years—meaning Bush couldn’t attend games and USC couldn’t use Bush for marketing purposes—but Bush was welcomed back at USC after the 10-year period ended last summer. Regardless of what is official and record and what isn't, fans and commentators widely regard Bush as one of the most electric running backs in college football history. During his three years at USC from 2003-2005, Bush amassed a combined 4,470 rushing and receiving yards while scoring 38 touchdowns. He was selected second overall in the 2006 NFL Draft by the New Orleans Saints, and went on to win a Super Bowl with the team during the 2009 season. Bush later played for the Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, San Francisco 49ers and Buffalo Bills before retiring in 2016. He now serves as a college football analyst for Fox Sports. //While it was believed the benefits Bush received at USC would have been allowed under new name, image and likeness rules, Durham said in a statement Bush had actually engaged in a "pay-for-play type arrangement," which is not allowed under NCAA rules.

Bush speaks during the flag-raising ceremony prior to The Walker Cup ... [+] at Seminole Golf Club on May 7, 2021, in Juno Beach, Florida. //In an interview with German news outlet Deutsche Welle, Bush called the pullout a “mistake” and argued that the consequences will be “unbelievably bad.”//Bush, who was responsible for launching the war in Afghanistan 20 years ago as president, said he’s worried Afghan women and girls are going to “suffer unspeakable harm” as a result of the withdrawal. //Bush said he’s also concerned about “all the interpreters and people that helped” U.S. troops and NATO forces, saying it “seems like they’re just gonna be left behind to be slaughtered by these very brutal people,” referring to the Taliban. //Critics worry Biden’s decision could lead to a Taliban takeover and the fall of the Afghan government as Taliban forces inch closer to Kabul. //Biden has said he views the possibility of a complete Taliban takeover as “highly unlikely” and reiterated that he has confidence in the Afghan government’s “capacity to sustain” itself.//“I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome,” Biden said in a speech at the White House last week as he announced the U.S. would formally end its mission in Afghanistan on August 31.//Bush’s comments come as U.S. intelligence officials warn that the Afghan government could fall in as little as six months under increased pressure from the Taliban. In the past two months, the Taliban have made huge gains, and now control 195 of the country’s 407 districts, according to The Foundation for Defense of Democracies. On Friday, Pentagon spokesperson John Kerby called the Taliban’s advances “concerning,” and acknowledged it was a “deteriorating security situation.” According to CNN, the surge in fighting has forced tens of thousands of civilians to flee. //Biden first announced in April the U.S. would withdraw from Afghanistan by September 11, pushing back the May 1 deadline former President Donald Trump set last year.

"Texas’ George P. Bush Sues Biden Administration Over Border Wall Pause", "Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush is suing the federal government for halting construction of a border wall begun during the Trump administration, the Bush family member and Texas attorney general hopeful announced Wednesday, the latest Republican-led lawsuit against the Biden administration.//Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush is suing the federal government for halting construction of a border wall begun during the Trump administration, the Bush family member and Texas attorney general hopeful announced Wednesday, the latest Republican-led lawsuit against the Biden administration.//A portion of the U.S.-Mexico border wall stands unfinished on April 14 near La Joya, Texas. //Filed in a Texas federal court Tuesday, the lawsuit asks a judge to invalidate President Joe Biden’s Inauguration Day executive order pausing all new border wall construction.//Bush argues President Joe Biden overstepped his authority by unilaterally cutting off a project Congress had already approved and partially funded, and he says the administration didn’t follow the standard procedure for changing federal policies.//Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich (R) is also suing the federal government over the border wall pause, accusing the Biden administration in April of failing to consider the environmental impact of halting wall construction, even though environmental groups have spent years arguing the border wall would be ecologically harmful.//Forbes has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.//“The [Constitution] strictly instructs the president to faithfully execute the laws that the Congress passes,” Bush said in a Wednesday press conference near the southern border. “The president has really only two choices: Either follow the law, or see your day in court.”//The Government Accountability Office — the federal government’s independent internal watchdog — says Biden has the authority to suspend border wall construction. In a June report, the agency said Biden’s delay is justifiable because it allows the administration to “perform environmental reviews and consult with various stakeholders, as required by law.”//Building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border was a campaign promise for former President Donald Trump, who ran on a strict immigration platform centered on deterring unauthorized border-crossing. Congress budgeted billions of dollars for wall construction, and Trump controversially diverted billions more from military funding, but after years of legal wrangling with private landowners at the border, his administration only built around 80 miles of new barriers where no wall had previously existed. Biden vowed to halt wall construction on the campaign trail last year, casting the project as overpriced and unnecessary in an era when many undocumented immigrants enter the United States legally and overstay their visas.//Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) is angling to build sections of wall on Texas’ border with Mexico without the federal government’s help. Abbott announced $250 million in state funding for his wall-building project last month, and the state has received some private donations. This push will likely run into the same hurdles as Trump’s plan: Some landowners on the Rio Grande say they plan on fighting efforts to build a wall through their property.//Bush’s lawsuit is the latest in a string of attempts by Republican-led states to push back against the Biden administration in court. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) sued over Biden’s plan to freeze most deportations for his first 100 days in office, leading a judge to halt the policy, and a group of states successfully sued to pause Biden’s moratorium on oil and gas leasing on federal property. This tactic is fairly common: California sued the Trump administration dozens of times, and Texas prolifically sued the Obama administration.//Bush’s lawsuit could boost his profile as he prepares to run against Paxton — a fellow Biden legal opponent — in a 2022 race for attorney general. Bush has sided with Trump for years, despite Trump’s intense criticism of Bush’s father, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and the mutual enmity between Trump and his uncle, former President George W.

"Unlike Trump, Bush Paints A Kind Picture Of Immigrants", "The cover of former President George W. Bush's new book on immigrants. //The cover of former President George W. Bush's new book on immigrants. //Former President George W. Bush tells the stories of dozens of immigrants and includes a painting of each one in a new book that should be on people’s shelves for its beauty and storytelling. While his talent for painting is notable, it is the heart the former president displays for his subjects that stands out in the book Out of Many, One: Portraits of America’s Immigrants. Through his portraits and stories, Bush tells the reader that America is not for only one type of person but should be open, as Ronald Reagan once said, to “anyone with the will and the heart to get here.”//Among those with “the will and the heart to get here” highlighted in the book is Paula Rendon, an immigrant from Mexico who came to work for the Bush family. “I didn’t realize at the time what a life-changing moment it would be for me, Paula, or our families,” writes Bush, describing the rainy night a small woman with a suitcase came to his family’s house when he was 13 years old in 1959. “Over the next six decades, Paula became an integral part of our family. She was like a second mother to my siblings and me. The first immigrant I really knew showed me how hardworking, family-oriented newcomers add to the cultural fabric, economic strength and patriotic spirit of America.”//The book includes portraits—both painted and written—of nearly four dozen immigrants from 35 different countries. Among them are many famous immigrants, including former secretaries of state Madeline Albright and Henry Kissinger, basketball star Dirk Nowitzki, golfer Annika Sörenstam, movie star and former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former head of PepsiCo Indra Nooyi. (Note: I worked in the Bush administration as head of policy and counselor to the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.)//The book’s charm is mixing in the famous with those who have lived extraordinary lives but might be unknown to most Americans. Bush describes the harrowing journey of Bob Fu, a Christian minister who escaped arrest in China and was accepted as a refugee to America “only three days before Hong Kong was returned to China.”//Thear Suzuki was born in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. “Thear’s family of seven managed to survive the genocide, which took place on sites across Cambodia now known as the Killing Fields,” writes Bush. “They worked in forced labor camps and lived in the jungle for years before escaping to a Thailand refugee camp in 1979.”//At 14, Alfredo Duarte crossed the Rio Grande into America to support his family. “There was a moment I thought we were all going to die, but we finally made it to the other side of the river, where we ducked and crawled,” said Duarte. He worked many jobs and sent money back to his parents. In 1985, he became a lawful permanent resident and partnered with his brother-in-law to start Taxco Produce, a food distributor that employs 120 people in the United States.//While the book is not political, it is difficult not to compare the vision of humanity and compassion George W. Bush expresses for his subjects with the animosity Donald Trump’s has often exhibited toward immigrants. //While Bush praises the heroism of refugees, Trump gave speeches during the 2020 campaign that boasted of cuts to refugee admissions and warned an entire state could get turned into a refugee camp. Bush writes about the family values and work ethic of Mexican immigrants, while Trump said many Mexicans were rapists who would commit crimes against Americans.//These are the two most recent Republican presidents, yet their views of their fellow human beings, fellow Americans, are so different. //“It depends on where you start your philosophy from,” said Bush in remarks at an event presented by the George W. Bush Institute, the National Immigration Forum and the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. “I started mine from ‘all life is precious’ and ‘we’re all God’s children’ . . . If that’s how you view immigration, then you don’t view people with a hostile eye. You view them with a loving eye. . . . A loving eye means treating people with respect.” //In his essay on Paula Rendon, the woman who helped raise him, Bush concludes: “Sadly, Paula died in February 2020 at the age of 97, shortly after I finished painting her. Four generations of Mexican-American family members attended her funeral. On that day, Elysia Ramirez, one of her 36 great-great-grandchildren, gave a touching eulogy.”//“We learned a lot from Paula,” writes Bush. “She taught us what it means to work hard. She taught us what it means to sacrifice for family. And she taught us to be grateful to immigrants, who keep the American dream alive by realizing it and passing it along to new generations of diligent, determined United States citizens.”//", 10.2%

(FILM) AFP PHOTO/PAUL J. RICHARDS (Photo credit should read PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP via Getty Images)//I often remind people that a U.S. president’s policies generally have limited impact on the energy markets in the short term. This topic often comes up when gasoline prices are rising or falling.//However, over the longer term a president’s policies can make a big impact. One of the examples I often use is President Nixon. //The Nixon Administration passed a number of policies that had a significant and long-lasting impact on the oil markets, but those impacts weren’t felt until he was out of office. For example, President Carter experienced a rise in oil production when he was in office, reversing a steady decline that had begun in 1970. But that was because the Alaska Pipeline was approved under President Nixon, and the oil began to flow while Carter was in office.//I recently reviewed presidential policies and how they have impacted the world’s energy markets, and I was struck by the ultimate significance of the policies of President George W. Bush. He may not be the first president that springs to mind when you are considering our greatest presidents, but I would argue that his energy legacy ranks near the top.//Like his father, George W. Bush had ties to the oil industry. Even Bush’s vice president, Dick Cheney, was an ex-oilman, having served as the CEO of oilfield services company Halliburton. Within two weeks of taking office, Bush named Cheney as the chairman of the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG). //The group’s purpose was to "develop a national energy policy designed to help the private sector, and, as necessary and appropriate, state and local governments, promote dependable, affordable, and environmentally sound production and distribution of energy for the future."//Quoting from my book Power Plays: //"The group’s work culminated in the release of the National Energy Policy (NEP) in May of 2001. The report warned that in the years ahead, America would face the most serious energy shortages since the 1973 oil embargo. //The report made specific recommendations designed to meet five goals: //////The NEPDG came under criticism because its activities were not made public and critics charged that the oil industry heavily influenced the outcome. In fact, many of the report’s recommendations were focused on increasing domestic oil supplies and ensuring that the U.S. maintained access to supplies abroad. //However, continued access to oil was only one part of a comprehensive energy plan detailed in the report. One area in which the group made specific recommendations was in the use of renewable and alternative energy. //Among the recommendations were an expansion of a tax credit for landfill methane projects, acceleration of the permitting process for geothermal projects, expansion and extension of the tax credits for electricity produced from wind and biomass, a new tax credit for residential solar installations, a continuation of the ethanol tax exemption, an income tax credit for the purchase of hybrid or fuel-cell vehicles, and the development of hydrogen and fusion technologies."//In his 2006 State of the Union address, President Bush famously stated "Here we have a serious problem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world." Many viewed his comments as disingenuous, but there is no question that Bush took actions that were ultimately successful in reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. //The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave us the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which mandated that an increasing amount of ethanol had to be blended into the fuel supply. In 2007 those mandates were expanded. This bill directly enabled the 17 billion gallon per year ethanol industry in the U.S. that still helps fuel our automobiles today.//President Bush pursued a hydrogen economy, but he was ahead of his time. A hydrogen economy failed to materialize at that time, but hydrogen is currently experiencing a renaissance as an attractive low-carbon transportation fuel. //But perhaps the most significant development to occur during the Bush Administration was the marriage of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"), which ushered in the shale oil and gas boom. //The Bush Administration passed a number of laws aimed at accelerating the development of fracking. Many of those laws were staunchly criticized by environmental groups, but there is no doubt they helped spur an enormous increase in U.S. oil and gas production.//The irony is that President Obama presided over most of this production surge. But it was put in place by the Bush Administration, and the impacts are still felt today all over the world. //Bush’s policies resulted in a huge increase in U.S. ethanol production, record U.S. oil and natural gas production, a dramatic drop in U.S. oil imports, and they ultimately broke OPEC’s iron grip on oil prices. //One could credibly argue that gasoline prices are as low as they are today because of the actions George Bush took as president. That is a truly substantial and long-lasting impact on the energy markets 20 years after he was first inaugurated.//", 15.5%

Then write on it.”//That's the advice from onetime speechwriter for former President George W. Bush and now Atlantic columnist David Frum on how to get media coverage in 2021. //It’s sound advice for small business owners, who are hard-pressed for the time to research topics, develop messaging and get coverage in the press. Only media which drives sales, improves marketing and creates brand positioning is worth pursuing — but how do you separate the wheat from the chaff?//You can get some solid ideas by following the strategies a trio of media personalities used to built their own brands. //The first step is to find your passion. If you don’t love it, nobody else will. Or as award-winning Washington Post personal finance columnist Michelle Singletary told Zenger, “I believe the most success comes from a natural interest or skill in a particular area.” //The second step is to be unique. If everyone else is doing it, you’ll never stand out — which means you’ll waste resources that could have been directed to more productive pursuits. Zenger also interviewed former CNN senior reporter Chris Moody on how being unique helped him create a brand that has sustained his career even while he and his wife left East Coast cities to travel America in a RV.//Finally, you must have a media strategy which turns your unique passion into real results. //WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 28: Michelle Singletary speaks during the Leading Women Defined: ING ...

It was chosen for me.” This is what Singletary returned to over and over again in an e-mail interview with Zenger. “Much of my financial wisdom came from my grandmother, whom I called Big Mama. She died in 1995, but her financial legacy lives on. It was her teachings that I would talk about to my colleagues and editors in the Washington Post Business section that resulted in a focus on personal finance.”//Singletary said that her passion started with “helping people become better stewards over their finances.” The awards, TV show, radio appearances, and four books came because she “developed and honed my passion,” and took the wisdom of her frugal grandmother into the marketplace of ideas. “Not one of my book deals came because I pitched a publisher, and I never sought to be the host of my own show,” she explained. “I did the work first, and put people first. The opportunities came because of that work.”//“I’m not writing for the industry,” Singletary concluded. “I’m writing for real people” — such as her Big Mama and others in Singletary’s life. “I learned about money management from a Black, southern-born grandmother who, when she held a penny, Lincoln would scream!”//LAS VEGAS, NV - OCTOBER 12: CNN correspondent Chris Moody and producer Gabe Ramirez participate in ...

He got his start at the Daily Caller, covered the 2012 elections at Yahoo News, and traveled the country as CNN’s senior digital correspondent during the 2016 elections.//“I spent most of my career in Washington and New York, which provided opportunities to grow relationships with reporters and editors in person,” Moody told Zenger. “We all worked on Capitol Hill or traveled on campaign busses for months at a time. We swapped stories after work at restaurants and bars,” Moody said.//Then 2018 hit, and so did layoffs at CNN. Moody and his wife have since traveled America in a RV, living everywhere from a Catholic monastery to New York City. Moody has become a freelance journalist published at outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The News Station. He attributes his continued success to a passion for politics and relationships he’s built over the years. //“Politics is the topic to which I return. It's where I started, and no matter how hard I try to escape politics, it always reels me back in,” Moody told Zenger. “But I've never approached journalism from a partisan or ideological lens.

"George W. Bush’s Painting Teacher Shows What He Can Do With A Quilt In A New Exhibition", "Sedrick Huckaby, George Walker Bush, 2017, oil on canvas on panel, 48 x 54 in., The Harlan R. Crow ... [+] Family//Sedrick Huckaby, George Walker Bush, 2017, oil on canvas on panel, 48 x 54 in., The Harlan R. Crow ... [+] Family//It can be tempting, when thinking about Sedrick Huckaby’s latest exhibition of paintings, which is open at the Blanton Museum of Art through December 5, to focus solely on the included portrait of former President George W. Bush. Bush has famously turned to painting as his most notable post-Presidential hobby, capturing everyone from Vladimir Putin to Malala Yousef with his brush, which while not expert, is not entirely amateur. //Lesser known than Bush’s favorite hobby is the fact that Huckaby, who grew up in Fort Worth, Texas, and received his MFA from Yale in 1999, was one of Bush’s painting teachers. “He was actually a great student,” Huckaby told me. “He listened, and he was very quick in terms of applying things that I was telling him.”//Bush, who was introduced to Huckaby at the latter’s exhibition in Dallas, was interested, Huckaby says, in making his work more “painterly.” “I really worked with him on loosening up, and applying a lot more paint,” he says. The former President, Huckaby notes, was gracious and outgoing. Huckaby’s tutelage is directly apparent in Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief’s Tribute to America’s Warriors, a book of portraits of 98 physically and mentally wounded Armed Forces veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. In the portraits, Huckaby lessons on bold, thick strokes, and confident use of color to create depth, are apparent. //In Huckaby’s own portrait of the former President, Bush looks somewhat more serious — and definitely thinner — than his official portraits. It’s almost as if Bush has suppressed his normal look of bemused bewilderment to give Huckaby a flatter, more universal expression to work with. Perhaps, one wonders, Bush gave Huckaby what he looks for in his own portrait subjects. In any case, Huckaby captures the President’s most notable features — his pointy ears, full head of gray hair and the triangular center of his nose — while at the same time transmitting a sort of gravitas and respect for a man he says treated him kindly.//Sedrick Huckaby, Filthy Rags of Splendor, 2011, oil on canvas on panel, 108 x 108 in.//Much more interesting, once you put the infamy aside, are the other paintings in the exhibition. Two depict quilts, which Huckaby says his own grandmother made. Huckaby says that his grandmother’s quilts were beautiful objects, an art form. His grandmother never called herself an artist, however. “The objects were not just made to be seen, they were also utilitarian,” he says.//Sedrick Huckaby, A Love Supreme: Summer, 2001–2009, oil on canvas, 92 x 240 in., photo courtesy of ...

A Love Supreme: Summer (2001) shows a wall of hanging quilts, in total a riot of color. They are the product of a painter’s exploration of his own talent — each fold, crease and tear is carefully depicted. Created in the decade or so following his graduation from Yale, it is easy to see how Huckaby painted the quilts in an attempt to apply high-brow academic theory to his own lived experience.//Sedrick Huckaby, Sonadores (Three Pieces), 2018, oil on canvases, overall: 72 x 72 in., The Harlan ... [+] R. Crow Family//More recent is Sonadores (Three Pieces) (2018), a triptych of three sets of portraits hung as if they are frames on a living room side table. They depict a family, Huckaby says, of Dreamers. There may be as many as 3 million Dreamers — or immigrants who were brought to the country as children, and do not currently have citizenship — living in the United States. In the portraits, the family members look confident and strong. Each of the four heads — father, son, mother and daughter — are tilted up towards the viewer. The mother suppresses a smile. The daughter raises an eyebrow. The son, his hair freshly cut, bears a similar mien to the one Rembrandt bore in his own self-portrait at age 34. This is not a family afraid, but a family proud. Although there can’t be a cheesier way of stating this, the portraits seem to propose, “We are the future of America.”//In retrospect, especially given Trump’s policy of separating children from their parents, Bush’s policies towards immigrants seem tame, even compassionate. Like Presidents before and since, he tried to balance a line between praising immigrants for their hard work, while at the same time noting that the path to immigration must be transparent. Perhaps his most notable contribution to immigration policy was that he doubled the number of Border Patrol agents in 2006.//Juxtaposing a portrait of former President Bush with portraits of a family of Dreamers — along with portraits of quilts, a medium of expression favored by former slaves and their descendants — creates a political statement, especially in Texas. The facile reading is that they all — President, black woman, immigrant — deserve to be elevated equally in the annals of history. But really, what Huckaby seems to be saying is, sure, I can paint a decent portrait of a former President, but look at what I can do with a freaking quilt. Bush, in the exhibition, is just a floating head. The quilts are masterpieces. The Dreamers are bodies, clothes, background. They are tight t-shirts, rumpled jeans, masculinity and femininity, the product of an artist observing carefully, and using his talent to capture every detail.//", 9.5%

Bush said the Republican Party has become “isolationist, protectionist, and, to a certain extent, nativist.” Mr. Bush said the rhetoric over immigration—and the situation at the Southern border—should be toned down.//“It's hard for Americans to understand, and I can't really understand, why a mother becomes so desperate or how a mother becomes so desperate that she's willing to put her children in the hands of a coyote, a smuggler,” he said in the interview with NBC’s Hoda Kotb, which aired live on Today. “And so there's been a lot of devastation in Central America: political upheaval, earthquakes and gangs and drug lords, and the people are totally intimidated and so they're streaming to our border.”//The interview—Mr. Bush’s first live interview in three years—included Kotb’s question about the trial of Derek Chauvin for the death of George Floyd. “I think the first thing, Hoda, is that people know that the trial has been conducted fairly and that rule of law reigns supreme in our judiciary,” Mr. Bush said.//“We'll see what a jury of his peers says,” he continued. “I think a lot of people have already made up their mind what the verdict ought to be. All I can tell you this is that if the trial is not conducted fairly, there is an appeal process.”//Bush said a fair judicial system is "really important for the confidence of the American people," saying "I think that's what's playing out on our TVs right now."//", 5.8%

She married insurance broker Alexander Ellis Jr. in 1946 after graduating from Vassar College with an English degree, the New York Times reported. She was close with her nephew, George W. Bush, and would meet with him weekly when he attended Harvard Business School. According to the New York Times, he called her “my favorite aunt,” to which she would say, “George, I am your only aunt.” She is survived by her brother, Jonathan James Bush, three sons, a daughter, nine grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren, according to the newspaper.//Nancy Bush Ellis, Sister and Aunt of Presidents, Dies at 94 (New York Times)//", 13.1%
