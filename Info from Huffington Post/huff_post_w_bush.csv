"‘He Lied’: Iraqis Still Blame Colin Powell For Role In Iraq War", "BAGHDAD (AP) — For many Iraqis, the name Colin Powell conjures up one image: the man who as U.S. secretary of state went before the U.N. Security Council in 2003 to make the case for war against their country.//BAGHDAD (AP) — For many Iraqis, the name Colin Powell conjures up one image: the man who as U.S. secretary of state went before the U.N. Security Council in 2003 to make the case for war against their country.//Word of his death Monday at age 84 dredged up feelings of anger in Iraq toward the former general and diplomat, one of several Bush administration officials whom they hold responsible for a disastrous U.S.-led invasion that led to decades of death, chaos and violence in Iraq.//His U.N. testimony was a key part of events that they say had a heavy cost for Iraqis and others in the Middle East.//“He lied, lied and lied,” said Maryam, a 51-year-old Iraqi writer and mother of two in northern Iraq who spoke on condition her last name not be used because one of her children is studying in the United States.//“He lied, and we are the ones who got stuck with never-ending wars,” she added.//As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Powell oversaw the Persian Gulf war to oust the Iraqi army in 1991 after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.//But Iraqis remember Powell more for his U.N. presentation justifying the invasion of their country more than a decade later by casting Saddam as a major global threat who possessed weapons of mass destruction, even displaying a vial of what he said could have been a biological weapon. Powell had called Iraq’s claims that it had no such weapons “a web of lies.” No WMD were ever found, however, and the speech was later derided as a low point in his career.//“I am saddened by the death of Colin Powell without being tried for his crimes in Iraq. ... But I am sure that the court of God will be waiting for him,” tweeted Muntadher al-Zaidi, an Iraqi journalist who vented his outrage at the U.S. by throwing his shoes at then-President George W. Bush during a 2008 news conference in Baghdad.//In 2011, Powell told Al Jazeera he regretted providing misleading intelligence that led the U.S. invasion, calling it a “blot on my record.” He said a lot of sources cited by the intelligence community were wrong.//But in a 2012 interview with The Associated Press, Powell maintained that on balance, the U.S. “had a lot of successes” because “Iraq’s terrible dictator is gone.”//Saddam was captured by U.S. forces while hiding in northern Iraq in December 2003 and later executed by the Iraqi government.//But the insurgency that emerged from the U.S. occupation grew into deadly sectarian violence that killed countless Iraqi civilians, and the war dragged on far longer than had been predicted by the Bush administration and eventually helped give rise to the Islamic State group. President Barack Obama pulled U.S. troops out of Iraq in 2011 but sent advisers back in three years later after the Islamic State group swept in from Syria and captured large swaths of both countries.//Powell’s U.N. testimony “resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqis. This blood is on his hands,” said Muayad al-Jashami, a 37-year old Iraqi who works with nongovernmental organizations.//While he did not suffer direct losses, al-Jashami said he continues to struggle with stress and panic attacks as a result of growing up with war, displacement, and years of terrorist bombings in the country.//Aqeel al-Rubai, 42, who owns a clothes and cosmetics shop in Baghdad, said he doesn’t care if Powell regretted the faulty information he gave on WMD.//Al-Rubai, who lost his cousin in the war, also blames the U.S. for the death of his father, who had a close call during the sectarian blood-letting that followed the U.S. invasion, and later had a fatal heart attack.//“What does that remorse do for us? A whole country was destroyed, and we continue to pay the price,” he said. “But I say may God have mercy on him.’//Elsewhere, Powell was remembered as “a towering figure in American military and political leadership over many years, someone of immense capability and integrity,” by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who backed the U.S. campaign and invasion.//German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted that Powell was a “straight-talking foreign policy official” and a “trans-Atlantic bridge-builder.”//The Israeli Embassy in Washington praised Powell for his “commitment to Israel and his deep personal connection to the Jewish community.”//Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland, said Powell was “a wonderful, moral man who was misled terribly in the context of the Iraq war before the Security Council.” Robinson heads The Elders, a group of retired world leaders.//But Maryam, the writer from northern Iraq, refuses to accept the idea that Powell may have been misled on Iraq.//“I don’t believe that,” she added. “And anyway, when lives are at stake, you do not have that luxury.”", 6.5%
"Trump Attacks Bush For Speaking Out On Sept. 11 Against Violent Extremists", "Reporter, HuffPost//Reporter, HuffPost//Donald Trump isn’t very happy about the speech George W.

So he hit back hard, pointing out that Bush is responsible “for getting us into the quicksand of the Middle East (and then not winning!)”//Trump then attacked Bush for lecturing that “terrorists on the ‘right’ are a bigger problem than those from foreign countries that hate America, and that are pouring into our Country right now.”//He added://“If that is so, why was he willing to spend trillions of dollars and be responsible for the death of perhaps millions of people?

Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of former President Donald Trump’s closest allies in Congress, on Sunday rejected a request for an interview by the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection.//In a combative letter to committee chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Jordan said, “The American people are tired of Democrats’ nonstop investigations and partisan witch hunts.”//He said the interview request “amounts to an unprecedented and inappropriate demand to examine the basis for a colleague’s decision on a particular matter pending before the House of Representatives.”//“This request is far outside the bounds of any legitimate inquiry, violates core constitutional principles and would serve to further erode legislative norms,” he added.//Thompson told Jordan in a letter last month that the panel wants him to provide information surrounding his communications with Trump on Jan. 6 and Trump’s efforts to challenge the result of the 2020 election.//“We understand that you had at least one and possibly multiple communications with President Trump on January 6th,” the letter read. “We would like to discuss each such communication with you in detail.”//In his response Sunday, Jordan insisted, “I have no relevant information that would assist the Select Committee in advancing any legitimate legislative purpose.”//He accused Democrats of using the committee as “a partisan cudgel against their political adversaries.”//Jordan is a staunch supporter of Trump’s false claims about voter fraud. The lawmaker brought those claims up during an October hearing on a motion to hold former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in contempt for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena.//In that hearing, Jordan admitted that he spoke with Trump on the day of the attack.//“Of course, I talked to the president,” Jordan told members of the Rules Committee, in response to questioning from the panel’s chairman, Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass. “I talked to him that day. I’ve been clear about that. I don’t recall the number of times, but it’s not about me. I know you want to make it about that.”//The panel is also seeking information regarding Jordan’s meeting with Trump and members of his administration in November and December 2020, and in early January 2021, “about strategies for overturning the results of the 2020 election.” Thompson’s letter said the committee is also interested in any discussions Jordan may have had during that time regarding the possibility of presidential pardons for people involved in any aspect of the Capitol attack or the planning for the two rallies that took place that day.//

"Donald Trump Reportedly Dialed Sean Hannity Into Oval Office Meetings", "Trends Reporter, HuffPost//Trends Reporter, HuffPost//Former President Donald Trump and his Fox News influencers were so joined at the hip that he even dialed Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs into Oval Office meetings, according to an unidentified former senior administration official, The Washington Post reported Sunday.//A “lot of it” concerned public relations — “what he should be saying and how he should be saying it; he should be going harder against wearing masks or whatever,” Trump’s former press secretary Stephanie Grisham told the Post, apparently confirming the information.//According to Grisham, Trump frequently consulted with Hannity and Fox News host Jeanine Pirro.//“There were times the president would come down [in the] morning and say, ‘Well, Sean thinks we should do this,’ or, ‘Judge Jeanine thinks we should do this,’” said Grisham. She described Hannity on CNN last Thursday as Trump’s “shadow adviser,” who counseled him on “many, many things.”//Jeff Cohen, author of “Cable News Confidential,” slammed the relationship as a violation of public trust by Fox hosts because viewers have no idea how close they are to Trump and are under the impression there is some objectivity to their on-air reports. //The startlingly close relationship between a sitting president and what the Post called a “Cable Cabinet” of members of a right-wing news operation was underscored by the multiple texts released last month by the House select committee investigating the Jan, 6 insurrection.//As last year’s Jan. 6 violence unfolded in the U.S. Capitol, Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham, Brian Kilmeade and Hannity all texted then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, pleading with him to press Trump to intervene to stop the siege. They all later downplayed the insurrection on Fox News, or even blamed the attack on the building on Antifa or members of the Black Lives Matter.//It was one of the few times Trump wasn’t listening to his Fox News brain trust. It took him more than three hours on Jan. 6 to speak out against the violence.//“He can’t mention the election again. Ever,” Hannity texted Meadows days after the insurrection. “I did not have a good call with him today.”//But Trump enthusiastically embraced just about every other “fantastical” Fox favorite, including support for now-disgraced attorney Sidney Powell, who repeatedly pitched wildly baseless claims of election fraud, informal Trump adviser Michael Pillsbury told the Post.//Trump’s Fox pals could suddenly “completely change his mind on something,” said his former communications director Alyssa Farah Griffin, and the staff would have to scramble to do damage control.//Hannity wielded clout even during Trump’s 2016 campaign, calling Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel to complain about strategy, according to the Post.//The first time then-Speaker of the House Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) met the president-elect at Trump Tower in December 2016, Hannity called mid-meeting, reported Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa in their book “Peril.” //Trump “answered the call as Ryan and his advisers sat silent. ‘Yeah, I’m here with Paul,’ Trump told Hannity. ’Oh?

"Bush Condemns Domestic And Foreign Extremism On 20th Anniversary Of 9/11 Attacks", "Reporter, HuffPost//Reporter, HuffPost//Former President George W. Bush drew a parallel between foreign and domestic extremists in his speech to mark the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks from Shanksville, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. He condemned both equally.//“We have seen growing evidence that the dangers to our country can come not only across borders, but from violence that gathers within,” Bush said from the field where Flight 93 crashed on Sept. 11, 2001, amid a struggle between terrorists and passengers.//“There is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home,” Bush said, “but in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard for human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit, and it is our continuing duty to confront them.”//While Bush did not explicitly touch on the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, his speech inevitably invoked the domestic attack on the seat of American political power that was spurred on by one of his successors, President Donald Trump.//Domestic extremism proliferated in the years after the 9/11 attacks as much of America’s resources ― as directed under the Bush administration and the subsequent Obama administration ― were focused instead on the threat of international terrorism. The FBI now considers domestic extremism a top threat to national security. //Trump was conspicuously absent from the events where current and former U.S. leaders gathered to mark the historic occasion. He is expected to provide commentary for a boxing match in Florida later on Saturday. //President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden spent the morning in downtown Manhattan at the former site of the World Trade Center towers to hear the names of the more than 2,000 people who perished there read aloud.//They were joined by former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D), New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), and a large contingent of elected officials either from New York or serving in the Biden administration. A ceremony was also held at the Pentagon. //In Pennsylvania, Bush was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris to commemorate those lost in the terrorist attacks and to remark upon the ways they altered the world. //“Twenty years ago, we all found in different ways, in different places, but all at the same moment that our lives would be changed forever,” Bush began his speech. He said later that “the security measures incorporated into our lives are both sources of comfort and reminders of our vulnerability.”//The 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks has prompted nationwide reflection on the great lengths that have been taken ostensibly to protect Americans ― from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to the Patriot Act and the National Security Agency’s massive program of domestic surveillance.//Both Bush and Harris remarked on the unity that emerged in the hours and days after the attacks took nearly 3,000 lives. Bush also spoke critically of the current political environment that “turns every disagreement into an argument and every argument into a clash of cultures.”//“So much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger, fear and resentment,” he said, going on to highlight moments of grace seen 20 years ago that better represent “the nation I know.” //Biden also traveled to Shanksville himself Saturday afternoon and offered praise of Bush’s speech. //“The core of who we are is not divided,” Biden said. //Bush had concluded his remarks by addressing American service members directly, telling them, “you have been a force for good in the world.”//“Nothing that has followed ― nothing ― can tarnish your honor or diminish your accomplishments,” he said, not two weeks after Biden completed a chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, ending the nation’s longest war.//Reporter, HuffPost//

Nearly 65 percent of the population is under twenty-five years old,” the former president said. “The choices they will make for opportunity, education, and liberty will also determine Afghanistan’s future.”//Statement on Afghanistan by President George W.

Shortly after invading the country, Bush also sent troops to Iraq to remove its president, Saddam Hussein ― one of Bush’s earliest goals upon taking office ― under the false premise that he was harboring weapons of mass destruction.//Karl Rove, who served as senior adviser and deputy chief of staff to Bush during his presidency, said Monday that his former boss and the former first lady are “deeply upset” about the Taliban’s immediate takeover and Afghanistan’s expected return to an oppressive Islamic rule of law.//“For 20 years, Laura Bush has hosted groups of Afghan women who came into the United States after beginning to taste freedom in their own country in order to learn about the opportunities that were available to women all around the world. And the idea that the Taliban is going to somehow allow that to continue is absolutely ridiculous,” Rove said in an interview with Fox News.//President Joe Biden announced late Monday that he has allocated $500 million in additional funding to help relocate Afghan refugees, as well as provide Special Immigrant Visas.//Evacuating Afghanistan has not been easy, however.//Staff and top officials were swiftly pulled from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul on Sunday, and flights were suspended at the Hamid Karzai International Airport on Monday due to swarms of people blocking the tarmac in a desperate attempt to escape. The airport is one of a few places in the country that remained controlled by U.S. troops, allowing for an escape route.//Seven people were reportedly killed in the airport chaos, including individuals who fell from a departing U.S. military transport jet.

Bush and George W. Bush and was a fervent critic of Trump throughout his one term in office.//Some elected Republicans “who initially reacted with horror” to the deadly U.S. Capitol riot that was incited by Trump were “now making their peace with it,” he wrote. And that’s “where things really get dangerous.”//“The repetition of the lies not only causes tens of millions of Americans to embrace them; over time, it deforms their moral sensibility,” wrote Wehner. “It creates an inversion of ethics, what in philosophy is known as the ‘transvaluation of values,’ in which lies become truth and unjust acts are seen as righteous.”//“Believing the deceptions also becomes a form of virtue signaling, a validation of one’s loyalty to others in one’s political tribe,” he concluded. “In this case, of course, what we’re dealing with is not just any lie; it’s a particularly destructive one, among the most dangerous a democracy can face. It erodes confidence in our elections, the rule of law, and our system of government.”//Read his full piece here.//Reporter, HuffPost//

Bush, the man whose administration pushed false statements to draw America into war with Iraq, said he is very concerned about the lies people spread on social media.//In an interview with NBC’s “Today” show on Tuesday morning, Bush expressed disgust with some Republicans who were unwilling to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election, saying they made him “sick.”//“What’s really troubling is how much misinformation there is and the capacity of people to spread all kinds of untruth,” he said. “And I don’t know what we are going to do about that. I know what I am doing about it. I don’t do Twitter, Facebook or any of that stuff.”//Today’s social media environment did not exist during the Bush years. But Bush and his administration found plenty of ways to spread misinformation and “untruths” nevertheless, most notably while trying to push the country into supporting their invasion of Iraq. //The Bush administration said that Saddam Hussein had a “massive stockpile” of biological weapons, reconstituted a nuclear program and had ties to al Qaeda ― even though officials had intelligence to the contrary and knew those claims were false. They didn’t need social media to get those lies out to the public.//In a speech to Congress making the case for war, Bush infamously pushed false information that Hussein, “sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.” After this falsehood was rebutted by Ambassador Joe Wilson in a New York Times opinion article, high-ranking Bush administration officials retaliated by exposing Wilson’s then-wife Valerie Plame as a CIA agent, blowing her cover, compromising CIA operations and forcing her retirement.//Bush’s foreign policy team was notorious for pushing misleading and false narratives in the press to advance the administration’s war aims. National security adviser Condoleezza Rice notably declared that war was urgently needed: “We don’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.”//A 2008 report from the Center for Public Integrity identified 935 lies that the Bush administration told in the run-up to the Iraq War.//The Bush administration’s lies were not limited to the selling of the Iraq War. Bush and his administration also lied about the U.S. torture program they initiated, the existence of “black sites” where detainees were tortured, the rendition of detainees to foreign countries that practiced the most barbaric forms of torture, and the mental and physical torture and murder committed by U.S. soldiers and contractors in prisons in Iraq and Afghanistan. They lied about their wiretapping program. They lied about the safety of the fumes after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and their effect on first responders.//It’s not as though Bush and his advisers were unaware of what they were doing. In 2004, journalist Ron Suskind, in The New York Times Magazine, quoted a conversation he had with an unnamed Bush administration official who boasted about the untruths they were spreading://The aide said that guys like me were “in what we call the reality-based community,” which he defined as people who “believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.” I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism. He cut me off. “That’s not the way the world really works anymore,” he continued. “We’re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you’re studying that reality ― judiciously, as you will ― we’ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that’s how things will sort out. We’re history’s actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.”//This disdain for the “reality-based community” became a meme among liberals opposed to Bush.//Comedian Stephen Colbert launched the first episode of his satirical show “The Colbert Report” on Comedy Central in 2005 with a rant in the style of former Fox News opinion host Bill O’Reilly in favor of “truthiness,” the reality that feels true whether it is true or not.//Colbert would go on to lampoon Bush’s penchant for falsehood to his face at the 2006 White House Correspondents’ Dinner.//“Now, I know there are some polls out there saying that this man has a 32% approval rating,” Colbert said. “But guys like us, we don’t pay attention to the polls. We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in ‘reality.’ And reality has a well-known liberal bias.”//When viewed from 2021, in the wake of the Trump administration, Colbert’s White House Correspondents’ Dinner routine reads as it could be an eery warning from the future. But Colbert was just commenting on the occupant of the White House at that moment.//Bush’s newfound opposition to untruths is itself a reemergence of his truthiness. He doesn’t feel, in his gut, that he worked to counterbalance the “reality-based community” with falsity, but it was Bush’s mendacious rule that paved the path for Trump’s.//Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPost//Reporter, HuffPost//

"Former Bush Aide's Slam Of Biden Press Conference Turns Into Self-Own", "Reporter, HuffPost//Reporter, HuffPost//Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer attempted to slam President Joe Biden’s press conference on Thursday, but only managed a major-league self-own.//Fleischer, who served under former President George W. Bush, had a problem with Biden bringing notes to the media, apparently thinking ensuring accurate information was a good thing.//After griping about it, Fleischer added this misspelled rhetorical question: “Is he really that week that he needs a study guide?” (sic)//Are you kidding me?  Biden is flipping through a typed, multi-page document, which i bet are Qs & As.  I've never seen a POTUS bring one of those to a news conference. Is he really that week that he needs a study guide?//Twitter users immediately pointed out the many flaws in Fleischer’s tweet.//Which is worse. Having notes for a press conference or lying the country into a 20 year war like your boss did? https://t.co/sk3TEsHWJu//You're right, a president should enter a press conference the same way America entered Iraq: with absolutely zero plan https://t.co/2s6YbbRldC//Fair pointLet's use the presidential podium to ponder ingesting bleach instead https://t.co/WolxgYpruU//Yes, Ari, no executive has ever used notes or readaheads to prepare for an engagement. You should absolutely die on this proverbial hill and you are so right, man. Speak your truth. https://t.co/ZKGt9YqPS5//Maybe I'm being a partisan here, but I'm okay with the Presidency being an open book test. https://t.co/oiOUmjmpub//One user pointed out that Biden is by no means the first president to rely on notes during a press conference.//Pat Buchanan used to prepare Nixon's briefing book; he got a note from the president after one press conference congratulating him on correctly anticipating every question asked. Nixon asked if next time Buchanan would please leave out the questions the press wasn't going to ask. https://t.co/0zbItNo8Ks//Others piled on Fleischer for misspelling the word “weak.”//Being prepared is how you do things like not misspell 'weak.' https://t.co/la0Gw0GzSi//My favorite genre of hubris on this website is when people land on the wrong homophone while questioning someone's mental acuity or intelligence."Is he really that week" is up there with the trolling staple of "your stupid." https://t.co/fQqw6jVUA3//Pro Tip: If you can't spell "weak," don't accuse other people of needing "a study guide." https://t.co/HEpuJ88SzR//Reporter, HuffPost//

"George W. Bush: 'Sick To My Stomach' Watching Capitol Riot", "Senior Reporter, HuffPost//Senior Reporter, HuffPost//Former President George W. Bush said he was “disgusted” and “sick to his stomach” as he watched the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol unfold.//Bush made the comments in an interview with The Texas Tribune on Feb. 24 as part of the SXSW 2021 festival, which was streamed online on Thursday.//“I was sick to my stomach ... to see our nation’s Capitol being stormed by hostile forces,” the former president said during the interview. “And it really disturbed me to the point where I did put out a statement, and I’m still disturbed when I think about it.”//He continued: “It undermines rule of law and the ability to express yourself in peaceful ways in the public square. ... This was an expression that was not peaceful.”//Members of that mob are still being identified and charged in the deadly insurrection, which began as a pro-Donald Trump mob stormed the Capitol building, angered by the former president’s lie that the election was stolen from him. There is no evidence to back up such claims, and top election officials have repeatedly declared the 2020 race as the most secure in American history.//During the SXSW interview, Bush was pressed on whether he, too, thought the election was stolen.//“No,” he replied. “What’s putting democracy at risk is the capacity to get on the internet to spread ... all kinds of stuff. ... But checks and balances work.”//He continued: “Look, politics has always been rough ... And right now we’re at a period of time, though, when there’s a lot of anger in the system, which then causes people to worry about the future of our democracy. I think it’s going to eventually work its way out of the system.”//Bush was one of the first Republicans to congratulate now-President Joe Biden on his electoral victory in November. After the riot in January, he released a statement saying the attack, which left five people dead, was “sickening” and blamed those who had helped spread lies after the election for fanning the flames of insurrection.//“The violent assault on the Capitol — and disruption of a constitutionally mandated meeting of Congress — was undertaken by people whose passions have been inflamed by falsehoods and false hopes,” he said in January.//In the interview that aired Thursday, Bush expressed hope that the forces that helped compel the insurrectionists would begin to diminish over time.//“History and the United States has shown these populist movements begin to fritter over time, and so I’m optimistic about democracy.”//Senior Reporter, HuffPost//
