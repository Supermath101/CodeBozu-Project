"Jeffrey Epstein Pilot Recalls Flying Trump, Bill Clinton And Prince Andrew", "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost//Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost//The late Jeffrey Epstein’s longtime pilot testified Tuesday about some of the famous people he flew on the disgraced financier’s private planes, naming Prince Andrew and former presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump among his many passengers.//“I certainly remember President Trump, but not many people associated with him,” Larry Visoski, who said he worked for Epstein from 1991 to 2019, told a Manhattan federal courtroom in the sex-trafficking trial of Epstein’s longtime companion Ghislaine Maxwell, according to the New York Daily News.//Visoski, who is the trial’s first witness, said he flew a number of high-profile guests of Epstein ― including the actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker, and violinist Itzhak Perlman ― and could see them as they boarded. He said the cockpit door was always closed during the flights, but that he was welcome to walk through the passenger area if he wanted to use the restroom, The New York Times reported .//Visoski said he didn’t believe that any of the passengers on Epstein’s plane were underage unless they were accompanied by a parent. He also said he never saw any sexual activity or evidence of it having taken place.//“I certainly did not,” he answered, according to the Times, when asked whether he saw any sex acts involving underage girls.//Visoski said he could recall meeting one of Epstein’s accusers, who has said that she was 14 when Epstein and Maxwell recruited her for sex with Epstein and other powerful men. Visoski said he remembered her being “a mature woman with piercing powder-blue eyes.”//Some of the celebrities identified as Epstein’s past guests, including Clinton ― who in 2002 praised Epstein’s philanthropist work in Africa ― have said that they were not aware of any misconduct taking place. Trump, who in 2002 called Epstein an old friend and a “terrific guy,” also told reporters in 2019 that he “was not a fan” of Epstein and that they had a falling out years ago.//Prince Andrew, who is accused of sexually abusing a teenager who was trafficked to him by Epstein and Maxwell, has publicly denied the allegations against him but also has not made himself available for questioning by U.S. prosecutors. These allegations are not part of the case being tried against Maxwell in New York.//Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to charges that she groomed underage victims for sex with Epstein and others. Epstein was behind bars awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges in 2019 when he was found dead in his cell, with his official cause of death ruled suicide by hanging.//Prosecutors have said that the sex abuse occurred at Epstein’s private properties, including his estate in Palm Beach, Florida; his Manhattan townhouse; a Santa Fe, New Mexico, ranch; a Paris apartment; and a luxury estate in the Virgin Islands.//Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost", 6.0%
"Bill Clinton Released From California Hospital After Infection", "ORANGE, Calif.

(AP) — Bill Clinton was released Sunday from the Southern California hospital where he had been treated for an infection, and will head home to New York to continue his recovery, a spokesman said.//The former president left the University of California Irvine Medical Center around 8 a.m. with Hillary Clinton on his arm. Dressed in jeans and a sports coat and wearing a face mask, he made his way out of the hospital slowly and stopped to shake hands with doctors and nurses lined up on the sidewalk.//He gave a thumbs-up when a reporter asked how he was feeling, and he and Hillary Clinton then boarded a black SUV. They departed in a motorcade escorted by the California Highway Patrol and headed to the airport.//Bill Clinton’s “fever and white blood cell count are normalized, and he will return home to New York to finish his course of antibiotics,” Dr. Alpesh N. Amin said in a statement shared on Twitter by a Clinton spokesman.//Clinton, 75, was admitted Tuesday to the hospital southeast of Los Angeles with an infection unrelated to COVID-19. He plans to continue his recovery at his Chappaqua, New York, home, officials said.//Spokesman Angel Ureña had said Saturday that Clinton would remain hospitalized one more night to receive further intravenous antibiotics. But all health indicators were “trending in the right direction,” Ureña said.//Hillary Clinton had been with her husband at the hospital and was accompanied there Saturday by daughter Chelsea.//President Joe Biden said Friday night that he had spoken to Bill Clinton, and the former president “sends his best.”//“He’s doing fine; he really is,” Biden said during remarks at the University of Connecticut.//An aide to the former president said Bill Clinton had a urological infection that spread to his bloodstream but was on the mend and never went into septic shock, a potentially life-threatening condition.//The aide, who spoke to reporters at the hospital on the condition his name wasn’t used, said Clinton was in an intensive care section of the hospital but wasn’t receiving ICU care.//In the years since Clinton left the White House in 2001, the former president has faced health scares. In 2004, he underwent quadruple bypass surgery after experiencing prolonged chest pains and shortness of breath. He returned to the hospital for surgery for a partially collapsed lung in 2005, and in 2010 he had a pair of stents implanted in a coronary artery.//He responded by embracing a largely vegan diet that saw him lose weight and report improved health.//Clinton repeatedly returned to the stump, campaigning for Democratic candidates, most notably Hillary Clinton during her failed 2008 bid for the presidential nomination. And in 2016, as Hillary Clinton sought the White House as the Democratic nominee, her husband — by then a grandfather and nearing 70 — returned to the campaign trail.", 2.8%

"Rep. Jim Jordan Rebuffs House Panel Interview On Jan. 6 Insurrection", "Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of former President Donald Trump’s closest allies in Congress, on Sunday rejected a request for an interview by the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection.//Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of former President Donald Trump’s closest allies in Congress, on Sunday rejected a request for an interview by the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection.//In a combative letter to committee chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Jordan said, “The American people are tired of Democrats’ nonstop investigations and partisan witch hunts.”//He said the interview request “amounts to an unprecedented and inappropriate demand to examine the basis for a colleague’s decision on a particular matter pending before the House of Representatives.”//“This request is far outside the bounds of any legitimate inquiry, violates core constitutional principles and would serve to further erode legislative norms,” he added.//Thompson told Jordan in a letter last month that the panel wants him to provide information surrounding his communications with Trump on Jan. 6 and Trump’s efforts to challenge the result of the 2020 election.//“We understand that you had at least one and possibly multiple communications with President Trump on January 6th,” the letter read. “We would like to discuss each such communication with you in detail.”//In his response Sunday, Jordan insisted, “I have no relevant information that would assist the Select Committee in advancing any legitimate legislative purpose.”//He accused Democrats of using the committee as “a partisan cudgel against their political adversaries.”//Jordan is a staunch supporter of Trump’s false claims about voter fraud. The lawmaker brought those claims up during an October hearing on a motion to hold former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in contempt for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena.//In that hearing, Jordan admitted that he spoke with Trump on the day of the attack.//“Of course, I talked to the president,” Jordan told members of the Rules Committee, in response to questioning from the panel’s chairman, Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass. “I talked to him that day. I’ve been clear about that. I don’t recall the number of times, but it’s not about me. I know you want to make it about that.”//The panel is also seeking information regarding Jordan’s meeting with Trump and members of his administration in November and December 2020, and in early January 2021, “about strategies for overturning the results of the 2020 election.” Thompson’s letter said the committee is also interested in any discussions Jordan may have had during that time regarding the possibility of presidential pardons for people involved in any aspect of the Capitol attack or the planning for the two rallies that took place that day.//

Stacey Abrams didn’t learn that.”//Later in the segment, Kurtz noted that Clinton did concede her election loss, something Trump has yet to do. //Kilmeade, one of the hosts of “Fox & Friends,” also bluntly dismissed Trump’s cries of election fraud, telling him to put up or shut up. //“If you did, in fact, get screwed out of this election, put together an A-team list of lawyers ― not the ones we witnessed ― and show us the districts and show us how,” Kilmeade said. “I have not seen any of that.”//See their full conversation below:  //Brian @Kilmeade says Jan. 6 was "the worst day in Republican history," but that even if Trump "did in fact get screwed out of this election,” he needs to show us the proof and it isn't helping him or the country to keep talking about it #Mediabuzz https://t.co/olW3e0wxw8//Overnight Editor, HuffPost//

"Donald Trump Reportedly Dialed Sean Hannity Into Oval Office Meetings", "Trends Reporter, HuffPost//Trends Reporter, HuffPost//Former President Donald Trump and his Fox News influencers were so joined at the hip that he even dialed Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs into Oval Office meetings, according to an unidentified former senior administration official, The Washington Post reported Sunday.//A “lot of it” concerned public relations — “what he should be saying and how he should be saying it; he should be going harder against wearing masks or whatever,” Trump’s former press secretary Stephanie Grisham told the Post, apparently confirming the information.//According to Grisham, Trump frequently consulted with Hannity and Fox News host Jeanine Pirro.//“There were times the president would come down [in the] morning and say, ‘Well, Sean thinks we should do this,’ or, ‘Judge Jeanine thinks we should do this,’” said Grisham. She described Hannity on CNN last Thursday as Trump’s “shadow adviser,” who counseled him on “many, many things.”//Jeff Cohen, author of “Cable News Confidential,” slammed the relationship as a violation of public trust by Fox hosts because viewers have no idea how close they are to Trump and are under the impression there is some objectivity to their on-air reports. //The startlingly close relationship between a sitting president and what the Post called a “Cable Cabinet” of members of a right-wing news operation was underscored by the multiple texts released last month by the House select committee investigating the Jan, 6 insurrection.//As last year’s Jan. 6 violence unfolded in the U.S. Capitol, Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham, Brian Kilmeade and Hannity all texted then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, pleading with him to press Trump to intervene to stop the siege. They all later downplayed the insurrection on Fox News, or even blamed the attack on the building on Antifa or members of the Black Lives Matter.//It was one of the few times Trump wasn’t listening to his Fox News brain trust. It took him more than three hours on Jan. 6 to speak out against the violence.//“He can’t mention the election again. Ever,” Hannity texted Meadows days after the insurrection. “I did not have a good call with him today.”//But Trump enthusiastically embraced just about every other “fantastical” Fox favorite, including support for now-disgraced attorney Sidney Powell, who repeatedly pitched wildly baseless claims of election fraud, informal Trump adviser Michael Pillsbury told the Post.//Trump’s Fox pals could suddenly “completely change his mind on something,” said his former communications director Alyssa Farah Griffin, and the staff would have to scramble to do damage control.//Hannity wielded clout even during Trump’s 2016 campaign, calling Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel to complain about strategy, according to the Post.//The first time then-Speaker of the House Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) met the president-elect at Trump Tower in December 2016, Hannity called mid-meeting, reported Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa in their book “Peril.” //Trump “answered the call as Ryan and his advisers sat silent. ‘Yeah, I’m here with Paul,’ Trump told Hannity. ’Oh? You want to talk with him?’”//Trump put the call on speakerphone and said: “Sean, talk to Paul,” which he did for about seven minutes, according to “Peril.” //Check out the full Washington Post story here.//Trends Reporter, HuffPost//

I’ve never talked to her. But I did say, publicly, on more than one occasion, that I was sorry. That’s very different. The apology was public.”//Although Lewinsky participated in the making of the FX miniseries by offering script notes and other suggestions, she wasn’t sure if she wanted Clinton to watch it.//When Guthrie asked her, “Would you want Bill Clinton to see this series?” Lewinsky said, “I don’t even know how to really answer that.”//Reporter, HuffPost//

"Bush And Clinton Portraits Hidden By Trump Are Once Again Displayed In White House", "Reporter, HuffPost//Reporter, HuffPost//The portraits of former Presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush have been restored to their former prominent place in the White House after they were sidelined during the presidency of Donald Trump, officials told CNN in a report published Monday. //The portraits were rehung in the White House’s grand foyer. They had been removed from the entrance hall in July of 2020 in favor of portraits of the 25th and 26th presidents, William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt ― both Republicans who served more than a century ago ― in an unusual bucking of tradition, where normally the portraits of recent presidents are given prominent placement.//According to a report by CNN describing the initial move, the portraits of Bush and Clinton were placed in the Old Family Dining Room, well beyond the sight of then-president Trump. //The room, renovated by Michelle Obama during her husband’s tenure as president, was infrequently used during the Trump administration and had been relegated to a storage area, not even shown off during public tours. //Trump hiding portraits of his predecessors ties in with reports that the 45th president largely shunned the idea of one day becoming a member of the exclusive inner circle of former U.S. leaders.//Kate Andersen Brower, author of the book “Team of Five: The Presidents Club in the Age of Trump,” told The Associated Press that Trump had “kind of laughed at the notion that he would be accepted in the presidents club.”//Trump also went out of his way to critique the men who had come before him, frequently accusing the Clintons of corruption during his 2016 presidential bid and even lashing out at Bush for filming a COVID-19 solidarity video in May of 2020.//For their parts, Clinton and Bush were quick to congratulate Joe Biden after his Nov. 3 election win as Trump made accusations of election fraud, and the pair teamed up with Barack Obama ― who does not yet have a White House portrait of his own ― to appear in a short video filmed at Arlington National Cemetery after Biden was sworn in, urging solidarity and healing in America.//Reporter, HuffPost//

Among his cases was one that integrated the University of Georgia at a time of racial segregation in Southern states.

He worked well into his 80s, going back and forth between the jobs at the Akin Gump international law and lobbying firm in Washington and the Lazard financial management firm in New York.//“To the world, Vernon was a towering civil rights figure, a confidant to presidents, and a counselor to CEOs and governments around the globe. And he was all of those things. But to those of us at Akin Gump, Vernon was also a wise and trusted mentor and friend,” the firm said in a statement.//“His achievements were doubly remarkable considering the obstacles he overcame as a Black man rising from the virulent racism of America’s segregated Deep South. Vernon burned brighter than the rest of us, with a vitality amplified by his imposing frame and resonant voice,” Lazard Chairman and CEO Kenneth Jacobs wrote in a memo to employees.//After gains in voting rights and equal access laws, Jordan’s approach was to push for greater economic opportunities for Black people, even in corporate boardrooms.//At an Urban League event Jordan said he told the organization’s corporate benefactors, “Don’t just give us money and don’t just show up for the Equal Opportunity Day dinner. That is not enough when you look at Black consumer power in this country. It’s not enough for you to come and shake our hands and be our friends. We want in.”//Under his leadership, the Urban League began issuing its annual State of Black America reports to assess the social and economic status of Black Americans.//U.S. companies such as American Express, Xerox, Dow Jones, Bankers Trust, RJR Nabisco, Revlon and Sara Lee put him on their boards, where he was often the only Black member.//Jordan was close to President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s, and Carter reportedly offered him cabinet jobs. Jordan would eventually become critical of Carter, saying he had not delivered on his economic promises to Blacks.//In 1980, Jordan was badly wounded as he exited the car of a white woman who was an Urban League member in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Joseph Paul Franklin, a former Ku Klux Klansman and member of the American Nazi Party who was convicted of a series of race-related murders, admitted to the ambush but was acquitted. He told authorities he hated interracial couples.//After 10 years at the Urban League, Jordan wanted something different and joined Akin Gump. Tall and imposing, he earned a reputation for being a charming and persuasive “Washington wise man.” After Clinton was elected president in 1992, he chose Jordan, whom he had known since the early 1970s, to head his transition team.//In 2008 when Barack Obama was running to be the first Black president, Jordan stuck by his longtime friends and supported Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Party’s nomination. According to the Financial Times, Jordan told Obama, “I am too old to trade friendship for race.”//Jordan’s first wife, Shirley Jordan, died of multiple sclerosis in 1985. They had one child. In 1986 he married Ann Dibble.//Additional reporting by Susan Heavey and Will Dunham; Writing by Bill Trott; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Steve Orlofsky", 11.4%
"Hillary Clinton Co-Writing Mystery Novel With Louise Penny", "NEW YORK (AP) — One of the world’s better known fans of mystery novels, Hillary Rodham Clinton, is now writing one.//NEW YORK (AP) — One of the world’s better known fans of mystery novels, Hillary Rodham Clinton, is now writing one.//Clinton is teaming up with her friend, the novelist Louise Penny, on “State of Terror,” which has a plot that might occur to someone of Clinton’s background: A “novice” secretary of state, working in the administration of a rival politician, tries to solve a wave of terrorist attacks. The novel comes out Oct. 12, and will be jointly released by Clinton’s publisher, Simon & Schuster, and Penny’s, St. Martin’s Press.//“Writing a thriller with Louise is a dream come true,” Clinton, who has expressed admiration for Penny and other mystery writers in the past, said in a statement Tuesday. “I’ve relished every one of her books and their characters as well as her friendship. Now we’re joining our experiences to explore the complex world of high stakes diplomacy and treachery. All is not as it first appears.”//Penny, an award-winning author from Canada whose novels include “The Cruelest Month” and “The Brutal Telling,” said in a statement that she could not “say yes fast enough” to the chance of working with Clinton.//“What an incredible experience, to get inside the State Department. Inside the White House. Inside the mind of the Secretary of State as high stake crises explode,” she said. “Before we started, we talked about her time as Secretary of State. What was her worst nightmare? ‘State of Terror’ is the answer.”//Fiction writing and worst-case scenarios have become a favorite pastime for Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. He collaborated with James Patterson on the million-selling cyber thriller “The President is Missing,” and on a new novel, “The President’s Daughter,” which comes out in June.//Hillary Clinton, secretary of state during Barack Obama’s first term, has written a handful of nonfiction works. They include the memoir “Living History”; “Hard Choices,” which covered her time with Obama, who defeated her in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary; and “What Happened,” which focuses on her stunning loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 election.//“State of Terror” appears to draw not just on her years as secretary of state, but on her thoughts about the Trump administration’s “America First” foreign policy. According to Simon & Schuster and St. Martin’s, the main character is “tasked with assembling a team to unravel the deadly conspiracy, a scheme carefully designed to take advantage of an American government dangerously out of touch and out of power in the places where it counts the most.”//Financial terms were not disclosed. Clinton was represented by the Washington attorney Robert Barnett, whose other clients include Obama and Bill Clinton. Penny was represented by David Gernert, whose New York-based Gernert Company has worked with, among others, John Grisham, Stewart O’Nan and Chasten Buttigieg, husband of Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.", 5.5%
"Clinton, Bush And Obama Unite For 'Mega Subtweet Of Trump' After Inauguration", "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost//Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost//Former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama came together this week to urge unity and a peaceful transfer of power ― a gesture many interpreted as a rebuke of Donald Trump.//The three men appeared in a short video filmed at Arlington National Cemetery shortly after President Joe Biden was sworn in. The clip aired as part of Wednesday’s “Celebrating America” virtual concert hosted by Tom Hanks and featuring performances by Katy Perry and Bruce Springsteen, among others. //Obama spoke of the personal pride he felt at seeing his former vice president ascend to the presidency, while praising the support he’d received from Bush when he was taking office. //“It was a reminder that we can have fierce disagreements and yet recognize each other’s common humanity,” he said. “And that as Americans, we have more in common than what separates us.” //Elsewhere, Bush added, “I think the fact that the three of us standing here talking about a peaceful transfer of power speaks to the institutional integrity of our country.” //Watch the full video below. //For viewers, the video was perhaps most noteworthy for Trump’s absence. The twice-impeached, outgoing president was never mentioned by name in the clip. But by the time Clinton called on Americans to “get off their high horse and reach out to their friends and neighbors,” many on social media felt it was too easy to read between the lines. //“Such a mega subtweet of Donald Trump, while standing in a former Presidents club that Trump will never be invited to join,” one person wrote. Added another, “I’ve come to the conclusion that Clinton, Bush, and Obama 100% have a group text they left Trump out of.”//Trump did not attend Biden’s inauguration ceremony Wednesday. He also refused to concede the 2020 election and repeatedly alleged ― without evidence ― that his successor’s victory was the result of voter fraud. Two weeks before leaving office, he egged on a violent mob of supporters that stormed the Capitol in a deadly insurrection. //Biden, by contrast, urged Americans to “show a little tolerance and humility” in his inaugural address Wednesday, calling for an end to an “uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal.” //It was a message echoed by his trio of predecessors in the video. //“I think if Americans would love their neighbor like they’d like to be loved themselves,” Bush said, “a lot of the division in our society would end.” //Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost//

"Ex-Defense Secretary Slams Trump's Hold On GOP: 'Maybe It's Time For A New Party'", "Reporter, HuffPost//Reporter, HuffPost//Former Secretary of Defense William Cohen, a Republican who served in the administration of Democratic President Bill Clinton, told CNN Thursday that Donald Trump is a shameful manipulator who will continue to control the GOP behind the scenes even after he leaves the Oval Office. //“The current occupant of the White House is a ringmaster, and what he expects to do is to snap his whip, and all of the elephants jump on the chairs,” Cohen said, calling out fellow Republicans who are sycophantic toward Trump. They include Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who announced Wednesday that he will object to the Electoral College certification of President-elect Joe Biden on Jan. 6.//Cohen has previously said that Trump’s administration was leading the U.S. down a path toward dictatorship. He said Thursday that those who insist on appeasing Trump need to understand that the 45th president will “continue to snap the whip whether he’s in office or out of office.” //“And every time they’re going to have to jump up and sit on that stool in order to satisfy him and his supporters,” Cohen said.//Asked about Trump’s desire to maintain control of the party — which would break from the tradition of previous one-term presidents — Cohen said that Trump has a “pathological” desire for power, and those who insist on supporting him are “diabolical.”//The former defense secretary also argued that there is a major division in the Republican Party between those who hold allegiance toward Trump and centrists such as Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah). Romney has argued in recent weeks that Trump’s voter conspiracy theories have damaged America’s international image.//“Maybe it’s time for a new party,” Cohen said. “One that abides by the rule of law, abides by balanced budget opportunities, fiscal responsibility, but also faithful to the people of this country who vote to elect them.”//Reporter, HuffPost//

"In Ruins, Syria Marks 50 Years Of Assad Family Rule", "BEIRUT (AP) — On Nov. 13, 1970, a young air force officer from the coastal hills of Syria launched a bloodless coup. It was the latest in a succession of military takeovers since independence from France in 1946, and there was no reason to think it would be the last.//BEIRUT (AP) — On Nov. 13, 1970, a young air force officer from the coastal hills of Syria launched a bloodless coup. It was the latest in a succession of military takeovers since independence from France in 1946, and there was no reason to think it would be the last.//Yet 50 years later, Hafez Assad’s family still rules Syria.//The country is in ruins from a decade of civil war that killed a half million people, displaced half the population and wiped out the economy. Entire regions are lost from government control. But Hafez’s son, Bashar Assad, has an unquestioned grip on what remains.//His rule, half of it spent in war, is different from his father’s in some ways — dependent on allies like Iran and Russia rather than projecting Arab nationalism, run with a crony kleptocracy rather than socialism. The tools are the same: repression, rejection of compromise and brutal bloodshed.//Like the Castro family in Cuba and North Korea’s Kim dynasty, the Assads have attached their name to their country the way few non-monarchical rulers have done.//It wasn’t clear whether the government intended to mark the 50-year milestone this year. While the anniversary has been marked with fanfare in previous years, it has been a more subdued celebration during the war.//“There can be no doubt that 50 years of Assad family rule, which has been ruthless, cruel and self-defeating, has left the country what can only be described as broken, failed and almost forgotten,” said Neil Quilliam, an associate fellow at Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa program. //After his 1970 takeover, Hafez Assad consolidated power. He brought into key positions members of his Alawite sect, a minority in Sunni-majority Syria, and established a Soviet-style single-party police state.//His power was absolute. His Mukhabarat — or intelligence officers — were omnipresent.//He turned Syria into a Middle East powerhouse. In the Arab world, he gained respect for his uncompromising position on the Golan Heights, the strategic high ground lost to Israel in the 1967 war. He engaged in U.S.-mediated peace talks, sometimes appearing to soften, only to frustrate the Americans by pulling back and asking for more territory.//In 1981, in Iraq’s war with Iran, he sided with the Iranians against the entire Arab world backing Saddam Hussein — starting an alliance that would help save his son later. He supported the U.S.-led coalition to liberate Kuwait after Saddam’s 1990 invasion, gaining credit with the Americans.//“He was a ruthless but brilliant man who had once wiped out a whole village as a lesson to his opponents,” former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who met with Assad several times, wrote in his memoirs “My Life.”//Clinton was referring to the 1982 massacre in Hama, where security forces killed thousands to crush a Muslim Brotherhood uprising.//The massacre, one of the most notorious in the modern Middle East, left hatreds that fanned the flames of another uprising against his son years later.//“A key element of the Assad regime’s survival has been: No compromise domestically, exploit the geopolitical shifts regionally and globally, and wait your enemies out,” said Sam Dagher, author of the book “Assad or we Burn the Country: How One Family’s Lust for Power Destroyed Syria.”//Bashar Assad borrowed heavily from that playbook after his father’s death in 2000. Unlike his father, critics say he repeatedly squandered opportunities and went too far.//First welcomed as a reformer and modernizer, Bashar, a British-trained eye doctor, opened the country and allowed political debates. He quickly clamped back down, faced with challenges and a rapidly changing world, beginning with the Sept. 11 attacks in America.//He opposed the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, worried he would be next. He let foreign fighters enter Iraq from his territory, fueling an insurgency against the U.S. occupation and enraging the Americans.//He was forced to end Syria’s long domination of Lebanon after Damascus was blamed for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Still, he tightened ties with Lebanon’s Hezbollah.//Like his father, Bashar Assad elevated family to insulate his power — a younger, more modern generation, but one seen by many Syrians as more rapacious in amassing wealth.//The Assad family’s gravest challenge came with the Arab Spring uprisings that swept the region, reaching Syria in March 2011.//His response to the initially peaceful protests was to unleash security forces to snuff them out. Instead, protests grew, turning later into an armed insurgency backed by Turkey, the U.S. and Gulf Arab nations. His military fragmented.//With his army nearing collapse, Assad opened his territory to Russia’s and Iran’s militaries and their proxies. Cities were pulverized. He was accused of using chemical weapons against his own people and killing or jailing opponents en masse. Millions fled to Europe or beyond.//For much of the world, he became a pariah. But Assad masterfully portrayed the war as a choice between his rule and Islamic extremists, including the Islamic State group. Many Syrians and even European states became convinced it was the lesser evil.//Eventually, he effectively eliminated the military threat against him. He is all but certain to win presidential elections due next year in the shattered husk that is Syria.//Still, Dagher said the war transformed Syrians in irreversible ways. An economic meltdown and mounting hardship may change the calculus.//“A whole generation of people has been awakened and will eventually find a way to take back the country and their future,” he said.//As U.S. election results rolled in, showing Joe Biden the winner, memes by Syrian opposition trolls mocked how the Assads have now outlasted nine American presidents since Richard Nixon.//“In my life, my fellow Syrians had to vote four times for the only president on the ballot ... Hafez Assad. His son is still president. After migration to the U.S., I voted for six different presidents,” wrote Zaher Sahloul, a Chicago-based Syrian-American doctor who left Syria in 1989. “I wish that my homeland will witness free elections one day.”//Hafez Assad’s legacy might have looked quite different had he not shoe-horned Bashar into succeeding him, Quilliam said.//“It would not have been favorable, but Bashar’s legacy will overshadow Assad’s legacy and make it synonymous with cruelty, willful destruction of a great country and the brutalization of a beautiful people,” he said.", 9.6%
"President-Elect Biden Names COVID-19 Advisory Board Stacked With Experts", "Senior Reporter, HuffPost//Senior Reporter, HuffPost//President-elect Joe Biden announced Monday the members of a COVID-19 advisory board as he transitions into the White House. The roster of experts and doctors will help guide his administration as it confronts a rapidly worsening crisis that has already killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and infected millions more.//The board will be co-chaired by three public health heavyweights: Dr. David Kessler, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration under President Bill Clinton; Dr. Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general under President Barack Obama; and Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, a professor of public health at Yale University.//The board will also include a slate of global health experts, infectious disease researchers and doctors.//“Dealing with the coronavirus pandemic is one of the most important battles our administration will face, and I will be informed by science and by experts,” Biden said in a statement. “The advisory board will help shape my approach to managing the surge in reported infections; ensuring vaccines are safe, effective, and distributed efficiently, equitably, and free; and protecting at-risk populations.”//The nation will likely still be gripped by the coronavirus as Biden returns to Washington in January. President Donald Trump has failed to institute aggressive policies to get COVID-19 under control, instead downplaying the pandemic and undermining public health experts.//“I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic,” Biden said in his victory speech Saturday, which was held outdoors and with a socially distanced crowd.//More than 237,000 people have died from the virus and the U.S. set a new record on Saturday after the country recorded 126,742 new infections in a 24-hour period. The nation also neared 10 million infections on Sunday, the last million being recorded in just a 10-day period as cases continue to skyrocket across the country.//Biden has been working with Kessler and Murthy for months and has spent the past few days assuring the public that he will enter the Oval Office with an aggressive plan in place. NBC News reported Sunday that he will personally begin calling governors around the country to encourage them to enact mask mandates and move down the line of power to local mayors to do so if he meets resistance.//“I want everyone to know on day one, we’re going to put our plan to control this virus into action,” Biden said in a speech on Friday. “We can’t save any of the lives lost — any of those that have been lost — but we can save a lot of lives in the months ahead.”//The other members of the advisory board are: Dr. Luciana Borio, Dr. Rick Bright, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, Dr. Atul Gawande, Dr. Celine Gounder, Dr. Julie Morita, Dr. Michael Osterholm, Loyce Pace, Dr. Robert Rodriguez and Dr. Eric Goosby.//Senior Reporter, HuffPost//

"Chelsea Clinton Explains Why Her Friendship With Ivanka Trump Ended In 2016", "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost//Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost//It’s official: Chelsea Clinton’s days of palling around with Ivanka Trump are over. //Appearing on “Watch What Happens Live” Thursday, Chelsea told host Andy Cohen she and Ivanka hadn’t spoken since their parents, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, battled for the presidency four years ago. //“I’ve not spoken to her since 2016,” she said. “I have no interest in being friends with someone who is not only complicit but actively taking part in this administration’s everyday collision of cruelty and incompetence.” //Given the marked difference in the political stances of their parents, Chelsea and Ivanka’s friendship had been the subject of intense media scrutiny for some time. In 2014, the two women appeared together at the Glamour Women of the Year Awards, happily embracing on the red carpet for the cameras. //A year later, Chelsea even compared Ivanka’s temperament to that of her own father, former President Bill Clinton, in an interview with Vogue. //“She’s always aware of everyone around her and ensuring that everyone is enjoying the moment,” she said at the time. “It’s an awareness that in some ways reminds me of my dad, and his ability to increase the joy of the room. There’s nothing skin-deep about Ivanka.”//Just days before the 2017 inauguration, Ivanka told “20/20” that she intended to maintain her friendship with Chelsea once her father was in the White House. //“She’s been a friend of mine long before the campaign, of course will be a friend of mine after,” she said. “I haven’t spoken about the specific challenges about this next chapter with her just yet, but I intend to.”//Though Chelsea and Ivanka were photographed in close proximity to one another at former President George H.W. Bush’s 2018 funeral, it appears things have now changed. //“It’s just really hard when there’s someone who’s actively embracing their candidate, whether it’s their father or not, who is trafficking in racism and sexism and anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia, and homophobia, and transphobia, and conspiracy theories and lies and is so fundamentally corrupt,” Chelsea told Cohen Thursday, noting that Ivanka is “more than complicit, as anyone who has worked for him for so long by definition is.” //“I don’t want to be friends with someone like that,” she added. //Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost//
