Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Vice President Kamala Harris' new communications director repeatedly wrote on Twitter that his former boss, Al Gore, won the 2000 presidential election and that George W. Bush was an "illegitimate" president.Jamal Simmons, a longtime Democratic operative and political analyst, was announced last week as the replacement for Ashley Etienne, who left the vice president's office last month along with other staffers.Between 2012 and 2021, Simmons tweeted multiple times about how he believes Bush "stole" the election from Gore in 2000. Simmons, who was the deputy communications director for the Gore-Lieberman campaign, also called Bush's first term "illegitimate."

"Yet when in the room w/him I stood and gave ofc respect."In a 2017 tweet, Simmons replied to a Twitter account, whose tweets are protected and unreadable, saying, "I said losing tickets. Gore Lieberman didn't lose."VP HARRIS' NEW COMMS DIRECTOR SUGGESTED BIDEN 'DAZED AND CONFUSED,' SLAMMED TRUMP FOR 'JANKY SCIENCE VACCINE'The revelation of these tweets comes as national Democrats paint Republicans as the sole offenders of perpetuating the "Big Lie," a phrase that the media and Democrats have used for former President Trump's claims that President Biden stole the election from him in 2020. A couple of weeks before President Biden was sworn in, Simmons continued to tweet his thoughts about the 2000 election, saying he thought "W stole the 2000 [election]," but added that he "still stood when [Bush] entered a room." A few years after the 2000 election, Simmons worked for then-Sen. Bob Graham's failed presidential campaign, during which he alluded to the Florida recount saying, "[Graham] knows firsthand what voting irregularities and disenfranchisement can mean for the electoral process." Simmons wasn't the only Democrat close to Gore who claimed that the election was stolen from him. Former Democratic National Committe Chairman Terry McAuliffe, who lost his gubernatorial race last November, questioned the 2000 election results several times.

"We won that election."Other notable Democrats who have claimed an election was "stolen" or that they actually won, include two-time failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams.

Cheney and his daughter, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., were the only two Republicans seen Thursday at a moment of silence on the House floor led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.PELOSI LEADS MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR JAN. 6 ATTACK, DICK CHENEY ATTENDS WITH DAUGHTER"How weak these Cheney Democrats have proven themselves to be," the Fox News host said. "They control all levers of power in America, and yet their message to the world is we can't govern and our democracy is about to collapse. Once again, China has to be laughing. They're doing its work." "[Members of the Bush-Cheney bipartisan regime] really care more about promoting democracy abroad than preserving it at home," Ingraham said. "They're the ones who don't really trust democracy because they know that when the people get their way, it means things like border enforcement, ending unlimited immigration, keeping politics out of schools and protecting women's sports. They simply can't risk another repeat of 2016."Representative Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming, right, and former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney.  (Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg via Getty Images)U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).   (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris.  (Pete Marovich/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Vice President Kamala Harris compared last year's Capitol riot to the attack on Pearl Harbor and September 11 on Thursday. By contrast, in the wake of the George Floyd riots, "almost all of the Democrats' … real emotion was reserved for George Floyd and his family and the protesters themselves," Ingraham said. They characterized the riots as "courageous demonstrations infiltrated by perhaps a few bad apples."She dubbed them "the costliest civil unrest riots in the [United States'] history, with insured losses estimated at over $2 billion.""All of the emoting and hyperbole [were] really the last gasp of the old guard," Ingraham said. "The dinosaurs of the Pelosi-Schumer age are about to go extinct. They know their political con game is coming to an end in November, and they're so petrified that Trump or someone with similar views will win the presidency in 2024 that they're even willing to team up with an old nemesis[, Dick Cheney]."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"Now today was just another act in their dramatic effort to save their dying species," she remarked. "Yet none of it's going to distract from their own failures on inflation, COVID, the border, these wars, [and] Afghanistan. And the GOP is never, ever going back to the Bush-Cheney playbook. No, thank you. To preserve democracy, you actually have to trust your people. But they don't. And they're ruthless."The panel on 'The Five' offer reaction and analysis after former Bush aide speaks out against unvaccinated AmericansFormer George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum and House Intelligence Committee Member Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., floated heavily criticized new potential ways to force Americans to submit to the coronavirus vaccine injection, one of which the panel on "The Five" called "despicable."Frum, now a writer for "The Atlantic" magazine, wrote a lengthy Twitter thread lamenting the lack of full compliance with vaccine recommendations and edicts, suggesting that one way to force Americans to get the jab would be to send unvaccinated patients to the back of the line if they had to go to the emergency room. "Seems the best option is 1) Keep encouraging vaccines and boosters; 2) Impose vaccine mandates where it can be done; 3) Otherwise return to normal as fully as we can, especially the schools; and 4) Let hospitals quietly triage emergency care to serve the unvaccinated last," Frum wrote over the weekend."If, at this point, you are still unvaccinated, you are not a victim. You are a cause of the victimization of vulnerable others," Frum claimed.He further described opposition to vaccines as "dumb ass malignity" and lamented the fact that the "malignant minority" is opposed to other potential mandates like "no jab; no fly."

That idea came in part from Swalwell, who along with Rep. Kai Kahele, D-Hawaii, voiced support for a policy that would essentially ban American citizens from traveling by air if they chose not to get vaccinated, according to Fox Business.Swalwell pushed the idea of an air travel vaccine requirement on Twitter Sunday, writing a "prediction" that the country "can go from 60% Americans vaxxed to 80% if we require vaccines to fly."Kahele's state has also been home to one of the nation's strictest coronavirus-era entry requirements. Before the COVID vaccine, travelers from the mainland had to test negative for the coronavirus from a Honolulu-approved test vendor and then file documentation with the state's "Safe Travels" website.

Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., furthermore recently introduced a bill co-sponsored by Swalwell, Kahele and Hawaii's other House member, Ed Case, that would "direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that any individual traveling on a flight that departs from or arrives to an airport inside the United States… is fully vaccinated against COVID–19."On "The Five", host Jesse Watters called the ideas from Swalwell and Frum "COVID hysteria back in full force.""Liberals are renewing their push for a forever pandemic," he said."David Frum from ‘The Atlantic’ had a truly despicable idea suggesting treating unvaxxed patients last at hospitals."Host Dana Perino further wondered aloud whether Frum and the proponents of the vax-to-fly policy drafted by Torres were paying any attention to the stark message the American people sent them with the recent elections in Virginia and New Jersey where Republicans overperformed in part because of voters' frustration with both socioeconomic lockdown policies and leftist school curricula.

"And you had this other problem where you have fancy people who can go to a big party and mingle around without a mask, [while] anyone who works there had to wear a mask," she added."There’s a huge disconnect … The inequality of this shaming is really big. We’ve never figured out a way to address natural immunity. We never figured out a way to talk about the fact that we do have [other] treatments. "For an example, David Frum's idea, like as you said, is despicable, and is also ridiculous because there are easy ways to treat it now with amazing advancements in science."Perino concluded by saying that making the liberal firebrand Swalwell "the face of telling Americans that you aren't allowed to travel" would be the best way to start a nationwide popular backlash.In other reporting on Fox News, host Tucker Carlson has pointed out Swalwell's penchant for coronavirus-era travel, including to Qatar, where he was famously pictured shirtless and looking exuberant atop a camel while its handler stood in the photo's foreground."The Five" host Greg Gutfeld remarked that the controversial emergency room policy proposal is proof that Frum is "a broken man" and that the Bush-era politico has been "suffering from irrelevance" as of late."He is pretty much just lashing out," he said. "Everybody knows people who haven't been vaccinated for legitimate reasons and there are therapeutics that can help and so on. So he’s doing this because he is a sad, sad, loser."Fox Business' Houston Keene contributed to this report.‘The Ingraham Angle’ looks into how President Biden’s radical mandates and rules are taking over democracy.In her "Ingraham Angle" monologue on Thursday, host Laura Ingraham warned that President Biden and the Democrats are continuing their quest to "hijack democracy" and fundamentally transform America into their globalist, internationally inferior vision.Biden, she noted, hosted the "Summit For Democracy", which took place between himself and other world leaders via videoconference Thursday.Seated alone at a round desk, Biden spoke about "choices we make in my view in this moment [that are] going to fundamentally determine the direction our world is going to take in the coming decade."BIDEN ADDS ‘WOMEN’ TO DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE DURING DEMOCRACY SUMMIT REMARKSIngraham noted that the title of the conference was a misnomer, given that European Union leader Ursula von der Leyen was also prominently featured.Von der Leyen, formerly the deputy party leader of recently-departed German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian-Democratic Union (CDU), spoke about "how painful it is when a small group takes unlimited power and imposes a single vision on all of society."Von der Leyen continued, "It is why we are proposing to add hate speech and hate crime to the list of crimes in our treaties."

Ingraham expressed concern with Von der Leyen, adding that the U.S. Democrats are probably ecstatic to hear such a gameplan:"I'm going to trust [Ursula von der Leyen] to regulate hate speech? OK – A transnational, undemocratic body that is totally unaccountable to the voters in their own country imposing speech restrictions to punish their political opponents," she said."Of course Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi would love nothing more than to do the same [in the U.S.] and they are trying to.""They see what is coming down the road if they actually let democracy play out here so they are going to pull out all the stops and make sure that does not happen, even if they have to hijack democracy to do it," she said.MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR SUGGESTS ‘FEDERAL TAKEOVER’ OF ELECTIONS IN REPUBLICAN STATES: ‘THIS IS AN EMERGENCY’Ingraham pointed to another far-left bill she characterized as one that would federalize elections, which to-date is a power constitutionally left to the 50 state governments and those of the U.S. protectorates."The reason Democrats are so rabid about the Freedom to Vote Act today, is that in practical terms it would be a Democrat incumbent protection racket, she said of the bill, being spearheaded by Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Jeffrey Merkley of Oregon, Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Jon Tester of Montana among others."Among other things it would bypass state authority by nationalizing rules for voter registration and mail-in ballots. That means bye-bye meaningful election security laws was liberals get lots of help from media elites to sell the myth about the dark cloud, antidemocracy cloud hanging over the GOP," she said.

Ingraham however went on to express hope that Republicans are finally making the electoral inroads needed to crush the Democrats' hopes for fundamental transformation past January 2023, remarking that from 1988 until recently, the GOP was "controlled" by the Bush family. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"The fact is Republicans, not Democrats, have become more democratic. … If you were on [the Bushes] good side, all was well but if you question them or, my goodness, if you dared to criticize them, you were shunned," she said. "But it’s not a democracy when your parties controlled by big donors in one small clique or family. For years the conservative grassroots were demanding real change in things like foreign policy, border policy, trade policy. But they were summarily ignored until Donald Trump came along."Host Laura Ingraham sounds off in her 'Ingraham Angle' commentaryIn her "Ingraham Angle" monologue on Tuesday, host Laura Ingraham called out several wealthy American business titans who are "collaborating" against U.S. interests to appease China for their own financial and corporate gain.Ingraham added that while several of those situations exist, President Biden's administration is explicitly focused on alleged White supremacy in America as the greatest threat to the homeland – and the president himself has taken a much more congenial tone toward the Chinese Communist Party than his predecessor, Donald J. Trump.CHINA IS USING OUR OWN TECHNOLOGY AGAINST US – THIS IS HOW WE FIGHT BACKShe played a clip of Senate President Pro-Tempore Patrick Leahy of Vermont asking whether Attorney General Merrick Garland believed White supremacy is the "most lethal threat" to the U.S. in 2021 – to which Biden's chief law enforcement official answered in the general affirmative."The biggest threat facing our democracy and way of life is the Chinese Communist Party," Ingraham said in response."Under Biden we find ourselves trying to play catch up with the CCP or blocking them in their efforts to expand their power across the globe," she said."It now has the largest number of active military personnel in the world with 2.1 million compared to our 1.4 million. By 2024 it is poised to have the biggest economy in the world – which has our elites licking their chops. The CCP basically owns big business in America."She made her case by pointing first to a reported "secret $275 billion deal" struck in 2016 between the CCP and Apple CEO Tim Cook.SEN. RICK SCOTT REQUESTS MEETING WITH NBA COMMISSIONER ADAM SILVER ON LEAGUE'S ‘UNSETTLING’ CHINA ISSUES"Now we know why Cook became such a CCP apologist, and how Apple recently became the top-selling smartphone in China," she said, reading aloud a news report on the reported deal.She added that Cook via Apple lobbied to water-down provisions of an anti-Chinese-slave-labor bill in Congress earlier this year, that would have restricted U.S. corporations from using slave labor of the oppressed Muslim Uighur minority in China's westernmost Xinjiang province.Another "collaborator" Ingraham pointed was billionaire investor Ray Dalio. The financier appeared on CNBC to remark that China is essentially an "autocratic system [while] the United States is a country of individuals."

"In China, it is an extension of the family – as a top-down country, what they are doing is behav[ing] like a strict parent."Ingraham replied that although Dalio later tried to walk back his dismissal of China as a "strict parent" government, "we knew exactly what he meant."BIDEN'S DEMOCRACY SUMMIT ALREADY SENDING WRONG SIGNALS TO AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES"Dalio's hedge fund just raised one-and-a-quarter billion dollars for its China fund: Can’t let a few hundred thousand people being tortured in camps get in the way of that windfall."She added that Republicans are also not immune from being in that collaborator group:Ingraham reported that a foundation founded by Neil Bush, brother of George W. Bush, received $5 million from a "Chinese front group called the China-United-States Exchange Foundation."

"Axios reported back in June that the funding was meant to "bolster the Bush China Foundation's efforts to promote 'a bilateral relationship that is functional, constructive, commercially robust, mutually beneficial and politically sustainable'"Ingraham remarked that the news about Neil Bush's group makes sense in light of what she called the GOP family's "overly optimistic and warm" relationship with Beijing. TOM COTTON SLAMS BIDEN ON BEIJING OLYMPICS: ‘THEY HAD NO PLAN TO PROTECT OUR ATHLETES’She recounted how President Bush granted China normal trade relations in 2001, which essentially set them on their current economic course upward."How’s that worked out for us?  About as well as the war in Afghanistan," Ingraham said. "But to be fair, every president except Trump misunderstood China’s ambitions or chose to look past their brutal crackdown on human rights."She added that Chinese autocratic leader Xi Jinping is likely laughing at the prospect of the White House's response to Chinese aggression and human rights abuses as a simply "diplomatic boycott" of the Olympics – remarking that Beijing likely won't notice if Secretary of State Antony Blinken doesn't attend the games.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"Every day, the message spreads – if you criticize China, it can hurt your career.  You can criticize the Catholic Church, evangelical Christians, and the United States. You can tear down statues and spread anti-American propaganda all you want:  but don’t criticize China," she said."As more Americans are silenced or self-censor, we will soon realize that the whole notion of free speech becomes meaningless – just like President Xi wants. This is the real crisis of American democracy.""The American collaborators are the cheapest dates around."Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer joins 'America's Newsroom' following the passing of former Secretary of State Colin Powell.When Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., soberly stated that America was not a racist nation, the mainstream media and Democratic elites wondered how a Black man could express such a falsehood.  As a Black conservative, I, like Sen. Scott, agree, and our two lives and the lives of many Black men and women like us are living proof that America is indeed no longer a racist nation and by far the best place to reach your fullest potential. Look no further than the larger-than-life legacy of Gen. Colin L. Powell. As our nation reflects upon Gen. Powell’s life following his tragic death after complications with COVID-19, this reflection provides reassurance of America’s exceptionalism. Powell, the son of Jamaican immigrants, was a first-generation American born and raised in the Bronx.  JUAN WILLIAMS: COLIN POWELL NEVER FORGOT HE WAS A ‘GRUNT’ – AN AMERICAN SOLDIERLike Gen. Powell, I too grew up in New York City and came from Jamaican heritage. Beyond our cultural and adolescent linkage, our ability to achieve the American Dream while being Black is living proof that this dream is alive and well and is there for the taking. Powell led his life by one of his famous 13 rules: No. 4, it can be done. Regardless of the situation, he had a vision (rule No. 11). After graduating high school, Powell achieved a bachelor of science degree in geology from the City College of New York. He later graduated with an MBA from George Washington University. While at City College, he joined the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) and would enter the newly desegregated Army as a second lieutenant. From his days in the Pershing Rifles, Powell would lead an extraordinary career in America’s armed forces, serving in Germany, Vietnam and South Korea, to name a few of his duty stations during his more than three-decades-long valiant service.  During former President Regan’s second term, Powell became the 15th national security adviser and the first Black American to serve in this capacity. In his last military assignment, he became the 12th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the youngest and first-ever person of Afro-Caribbean descent. When you think of Gen. Powell, you think of many words, one in particular: trailblazer. He was a man of many firsts, including the first Black American to serve as secretary of state. His service during the Bush administration came a critical time in American history, with the Sept. 11 attacks coming months after the inauguration.   My success in business and politics was only possible through the tenacious and intrepid spirit of men like Gen. Powell. Throughout his life of public service, many would wonder how anyone could dedicate such time to one’s nation. Enter rule No. 13: Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. Through all the ups and downs of his tenure in the armed services and government, Powell remained optimistic about America’s future, and throughout it all, he remained calm and did it with kindness (rule No. 10). Some in my party will dismiss many of his undeniable accomplishments due to his disappointing fallout with the party I am proud to represent, but I remember his rule No. 2: get mad, then get over it. Here is a complete list of his 13 rules:*It ain’t as bad as you think. It will look better in the morning.*Get mad, then get over it.*Avoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls, your ego goes with it.*It can be done.*Be careful what you choose.*Don’t let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision.*You can’t make someone else’s choices.*Check small things.*Share credit.*Remain calm. Be kind.*Have a vision.*Don’t take counsel of your fears or naysayers.*Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier. The life of Gen. Colin Powell, a Black man in America, is only possible in the United States of America. While I never had the honor of knowing or even meeting him, I genuinely believe that we share this belief.  As a Black man, several generations to his junior, my success in business and politics was only possible through the tenacious and intrepid spirit of men like Gen. Powell. Today, we mourn the loss of a monumental American, but let us remember his ability to overcome obstacles, remain dignified, and dismantle the idea that America is an irredeemable nation.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPGen. Colin L. Powell is the definition of America. If we remember that, America will survive any attempts to transform the most incredible country known to man and the headwinds of today and tomorrow. May he rest In eternal peace.   CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP. BYRON DONALDSFox News correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on the president's declining approval on ‘Special Report’.President Biden's eroding poll numbers have been a major story line in the political world for nearly three months.And with the presidential approval rating a much watched indicator of how his party will perform in next year’s midterm elections – when the Democrats will fight to keep their razor-thin majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate – each drop in Biden’s numbers is likely to induce more anxiety in Democratic circles.The president currently stands at 43% approval and 51% disapproval in an average of the latest national polls compiled by Real Clear Politics. While that’s nothing for Biden to brag about, it’s better than his predecessor in the White House. Donald Trump stood at 40% approval and 55% disapproval in an average of the polls at this point in his first year in office. WHERE BIDEN STANDS IN THE LATEST FOX NEWS NATIONAL POLLBut Biden trails his two most recent Democratic predecessors.Barack Obama stood at 52%-43% on this date in 2009, and Bill Clinton was just above water, at 48%-45% in late October of 1993. Republican President George W. Bush was at 88% approval and 9% disapproval in October of 2001, as the country briefly tossed aside partisanship and united in the wake of the horrendous 9/11 terrorist attacks.While Bush’s approval ratings eventually fell from the stratosphere, they remained healthy throughout the 2002 midterm election year – as the nation fought the war on terror in Afghanistan – and the GOP made minor gains in both the House and Senate.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)But Clinton and Obama didn’t fare nearly as well. Both presidents’ approval ratings slipped into negative territory by the time the midterm campaigns heated up, fueling massive Republican waves in the 1994 and 2010 midterms. And Trump’s negative numbers didn’t improve during the 2018 midterms, when the Democrats stormed back to capture the House majority.Will history repeat itself in 2022?"Biden’s declining ratings on the economy must be a major concern for the White House," Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News poll with Democrat Chris Anderson, highlighted. "Historically, bad economic news spells trouble for the incumbent party in the midterms."BIDEN'S APPROVAL ON THE ECONOMY PLUNGES IN NEW FOX NEWS POLLShaw was pointing to Biden’s 39% approval on handling the economy in the latest Fox News national poll, which was conducted Oct. 16-19. The president’s approval on the economy plunged 11 points from the previous Fox News poll, which was conducted a month ago. The drop comes amid a rise in inflation, which has fueled a jump in gas and food prices.Biden’s approval rating hovered in the low to mid 50s during his first six months in the White House. But the president’s numbers started sagging in August in the wake of Biden's much-criticized handling of the turbulent U.S. exit from Afghanistan and following a surge in COVID cases this summer among mainly unvaccinated people due to the spread of the highly infectious delta variant as the nation continues to combat the coronavirus, the worst pandemic to strike the globe in a century. The president’s flagging numbers were also compounded by the latest surge of migrants trying to cross into the U.S. along the southern border with Mexico, as well as the rise in consumer prices.CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL POLL RESULTSAlarmingly, the drop in the president’s approval appears to be coming from two groups that helped fuel the blue wave in 2018 and Biden’s defeat of Trump in the 2020 presidential election.Biden’s approval among independent voters dropped from 43% in September to 36% now – and he sank nine points among suburban women – from 59% in September to 50% this month.Former Bush adviser Karl Rove reflects on the life and career of Colin Powell, his role in the Iraq war and his disenchantment with the Republican Party.It was an enormous shock to learn that Colin Powell died at 84 of complications from COVID-19.His devotion to duty, commitment to America, and innate sense of dignity and decency made him seem ageless and timeless. We live near the Powells in McLean, Virginia. Our pictures hang side-by-side at Simon’s Shoe and Luggage Repair. As a four-star general, secretary of state and national security adviser, Powell wandered around town as a normal citizen. He greeted one and all with courtesy and kindness.KT MCFARLAND: COLIN POWELL'S GREATEST GIFT TO US ALLEvery young American should learn about Gen. Powell’s life. He was born in Harlem. His parents were immigrants from Jamaica. And they taught him to study, to be courteous, and to do his duty. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERAfter graduating from City College of New York (the first free public school of higher education in the United States), Powell became a career Army officer. He joined Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) while in college and found that he enjoyed the work, the structure and the discipline. While he was a geology major, he rapidly focused on military education and rose steadily.Every time we saw Gen. Powell, he personified dignity and friendliness. These personal traits served him well throughout his life, and especially during the Reagan years, when he served as deputy national security adviser and national security adviser. Gen. Powell had a practical, down-to-earth approach to asking questions, thinking through problems, and briefing the president and senior leadership.When President George H.W. Bush, with whom he served in the Reagan White House, called on him as chairman of the Joint Chiefs to design a decisive occupation of Panama, and to eliminate the narco-dictatorship of Noriega, Powell responded with a commitment to overwhelming force and precision. The Panama operation was flawless and set the stage for the vastly bigger operation required to oust Saddam Hussein after he occupied Kuwait.Gen. Powell’s finest military moment was the marshaling of forces and the education of the American news media (and through them the public). The briefings by Chairman Powell were amazing. He was knowledgeable, firm and pleasant. But he had an austere military bearing that radiated reassurance. The campaign went even better than people expected. A 37-day air campaign so demoralized and disrupted Iraqi forces that the ground campaign lasted only four days.Gen. Powell retired as the most widely respected American military leader since Gens. Dwight Eisenhower and George MarshallThe aftermath of the first Iraq War fit the heart of the Powell Doctrine – have limited goals, use overwhelming force, and be thoughtful about the post-war environment you want to create. America used this model in Panama and then in Iraq. Having deliberately limited goals was a key part of the Powell Doctrine and was clearly violated a decade later in both Afghanistan and Iraq.Gen. Powell retired as the most widely respected American military leader since Gens. Dwight Eisenhower and George Marshall. He was urged to run for president in both 1996 and 2000 but wisely decided it was not his calling. Instead, he helped others, in particular President George W. Bush.Gen. Powell then became secretary of state (he was the first African American secretary of state). He was popular in the State Department and took major steps to raise the morale of the foreign service.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe most controversial act of his long career came when he represented the United States at the United Nations Security Council and made the case that Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction. There is no question that Secretary Powell believed the accusation. He had personally gone to the Central Intelligence Agency and reviewed the case. It seemed strong. It was wrong.

You will own all their hopes, aspirations, and problems.

"Never neglect details," he said."If you are going to achieve excellence in big things, you develop the habit in little matters," he also wrote. "Excellence is not an exception, it is a prevailing attitude."Powell also warned against trusting so-called experts.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"Don’t be buffaloed by experts and elites," he said.
